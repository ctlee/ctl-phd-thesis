Efficient prediction and ranking of small molecule binders by their kinetic (\kon and \koff) and thermodynamic ($\Delta G$) properties can be a valuable metric for 
drug lead optimization, as these quantities are often indicators of \textit{in vivo} efficacy. 
We have 
previously described a hybrid molecular dynamics, Brownian dynamics, and milestoning model, Simulation Enabled Estimation of Kinetic 
Rates (SEEKR), that can predict \kon's, \koff's, and $\Delta G$'s. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for ranking a 
series of seven small molecule compounds for the model system, \bcd, based on predicted \kon's and \koff's. We compare our results using 
SEEKR to experimentally determined rates as well as rates calculated using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and show that 
SEEKR can effectively rank the compounds by \koff and $\Delta G$ with reduced computational cost. We also provide a discussion of 
convergence properties and sensitivities of calculations with SEEKR to establish ``best practices'' for its future use.
