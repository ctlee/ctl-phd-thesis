\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{System Preparation}
\par GAFF\cite{Wang2004,Wang2006} forcefield parameters for the seven guest molecule
along with both GAFF and Q4MD-CD\cite{Cezard2011} parameterizations of $\beta$-cyclodextrin
were obtained from Tang and Chang\cite{Tang2017}. For comparison we use identical structure and
parameterizations as those used in their study. These initial structures were
used by the SEEKR software for preparation of the milestoning simulations.
The preparation procedure was the same for each of the seven guest molecules and
followed standard SEEKR protocols\cite{Votapka2017}. All systems were solvated
with TIP3P waters\cite{Jorgensen1983a}.

\subsubsection*{Preparation of milestoning simulations with SEEKR}
\par The bound state of the host-guest complex was defined as the center of mass (COM)
of the \bcd. The guest molecule was considered to be bound when
its COM was within 1.5~\AA of the bound state coordinates. From this bound state,
spherical milestones were defined in increasing 1.5~\AA increments from 1.5~\AA to
13.5~\AA. Furthermore, spherical milestones of radius 7.5~\AA and less, were
divided into two half-spheres to better capture the asymmetries between the two faces.
When the ligand is less than 7.5~\AA away from the bound state, it is trapped on
a particular face due to the size of the host molecule. For milestone distances
greater than 7.5~\AA, the ligand was found to freely sample both faces, and therefore
a single spherical milestone was sufficient for sampling host-guest interactions.
In total, 14 unique milestones were defined. In practice, this was achieved via
post-processing the simulations on each face to identify any trajectories that
crossed from one face to the other, and modifying the transitions accordingly in
the milestoning model. In addition, two simulations were conducted for the outermost
milestones (one with the ligand initiated on each face), and these were then
combined into a single milestone (with double the sampling) for milestones that
were not restricted to a particular face.


\par The first 13 milestones correspond to the MD region, while the 14th and
outermost milestone corresponds to the BD region. The standard SEEKR preparation
protocol\cite{Votapka2017} was then used to generate the coordinate, parameter,
and simulation files necessary for a milestoning calculation. For each of the MD
milestones, a copy of the apo \bcd structure was generated and the guest
molecule was then placed at the appropriate radius from the bound state coordinates.
Any water molecules that clashed with the guest molecule were removed. The guest
distribution for the BD milestone was constructed by first running a conventional
BD simulation where trajectories terminated at the appropriate distance for the
milestone surface (13.5~\AA).

\subsection*{Simulation}
\subsubsection*{MD Simulations}
\par A modified version of NAMD 2.12 was used for all MD simulations\cite{Phillips2005}.
For all 13 milestones in the MD region, the standard SEEKR procedure for
minimization, equilibration and simulation was followed. First, 5000 steps of
minimization were performed to allow for relaxation, particularly of solvent,
around the newly placed guest molecule. Further relaxation of the solvent was
achieved by a series of 2~ps heating simulations that gradually increased the
temperature from 298~K to 350~K and then cooled back to 298~K. Host and guest atoms
were constrained during these heating simulations to ensure that the guest
remained on the appropriate milestone surface. To obtain the equilibrium
distribution of the guest molecule on each milestone, 200 ns of constant
volume simulation was performed. A $\SI{90}{kcal\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot\angstrom^{-2}}$
harmonic restraint was used to hold the COM of the guest molecule at the appropriate
distance from the binding site. To minimize any bias of the arbitrary guest
starting conformation, the first 40~ns of each simulation were discarded and
therefore were not included as part of the equilibrium distribution. From these
trajectories, position and velocity configurations were selected every 0.2~ns,
resulting in a total of 800 configurations per milestone. To obtain the first
hitting point distribution (FHPD) of each milestone, 10 independent and
unrestrained simulations were initiated from these equilibrium configurations.
Each simulation was propagated backwards in time by reversing its velocity at
constant energy and volume (a total of 8000 reversals for each milestone).
Only trajectories that struck an adjacent milestone before recrossing the
milestone on which they originated were included as part of the FHPD for that
milestone. To obtain the transition probabilities and times necessary for the
calculation of kinetic parameters, all members of the FHPD were brought back to
their starting position and velocity and new unrestrained simulations were then
initiated from each configuration. These simulations were propagated forward in
time at constant energy and volume. Once a simulation crossed its starting
milestone again, it was monitored for crossing of adjacent milestones.
When an adjacent milestone was crossed, the simulation was stopped and the
transition and incubation time were recorded. Although more of the equilibrium
simulation trajectories could likely have been used without biasing the results
based on the starting conformation, the 8000 reversal trajectories that resulted
from the 160~ns used were more than sufficient to sample the transitions between
the milestones, resulting in hundreds of observed transitions between each milestone.
In total, 2.6~${\mu}s$ of equilibrium sampling (160~ns for 16 milestones) were
used and approximately 570~ns of FHPD sampling for a total of 3.2~${\mu}s$ of
simulation used in the milestoning model. The total cost per ligand (including
simulation discarded for equilibration) was therefore $\sim$3.8 ${\mu}s$.
 %This is roughly half of the simulation time needed by Tang and Chang.

\subsubsection*{BD Simulations}
\par All BD simulations were performed using the BrownDye software package\cite{Huber2010}.
Electrostatic potentials of the host and guest molecules used as inputs for the
BD simulation were calculated with APBS version 1.4\cite{Baker2001}. To match
experimental conditions, APBS calculations and BD simulations were carried out
with a solvent dielectric of 78, a solute dielectric of 2, and zero ionic concentration.
An initial series of simulations were initiated from the b-surface, a sphere that
encloses the entire host molecule and has sufficient radius for the guest molecule
to be situated in bulk solvent such that forces between the host and guest are centrosymmetric.
$10^6$ independent BD simulations were initiated from random points on the b-surface
and and were propagated until the guest either contacted the outermost milestone
(13.5~\AA) or escaped. Trajectories that successfully contacted the 13.5~\AA milestone
were used as the FHPD for this milestone. Another series of $10^6$ BD simulations
were initiated from the FHPD and propagated until contacting the second-outermost
milestone (12.0~\AA) or escaping to the q-surface. This procedure is automated by
SEEKR.

\subsection*{Milestoning Calculations}
\par Statistics from all milestones in the MD and BD regions were extracted
using SEEKR and combined to construct a transition kernel as well as an incubation
time vector. These are the two key quantities for the calculation of kinetic
parameters in milestoning theory.\cite{Faradjian2004} As described previously,
a post-simulation analysis was performed to account for ligand transitions
between the two faces of the \bcd ring for milestones of radius 7.5~\AA
or less. The analysis portion of SEEKR was then used to compute the desired
kinetic quantities, \kon and \koff, as well as the free energy of binding $\Delta G_{bind}$.
