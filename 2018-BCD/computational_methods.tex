\par GAFF\cite{Wang2004,Wang2006} forcefield parameters for the seven guest molecule
along with both GAFF and Q4MD-CD\cite{Cezard2011} parameterizations of $\beta$-cyclodextrin 
were obtained from Tang and Chang\cite{Tang2017}. For comparison we use identical structures and
parameterizations as those used in their study. These initial structures were 
used by the SEEKR software for preparation of the milestoning simulations. 
The preparation procedure was the same for each of the seven guest molecules and 
followed standard SEEKR protocols\cite{Votapka2017}. All systems were solvated 
with TIP3P waters\cite{Jorgensen1983a}. All BD simulations were performed using the BrownDye software package\cite{Huber2010}. 
Electrostatic potentials of the host and guest molecules used as inputs for the 
BD simulation were calculated with APBS version 1.4\cite{Baker2001}. 
A modified version of NAMD 2.12 was used for all MD simulations\cite{Phillips2005}.
For all 13 milestones in the MD region, the standard SEEKR procedure for 
minimization, equilibration and simulation was followed. In total, 2.6~${\mu}s$ of equilibrium sampling (160~ns for 16 milestones) were 
used and approximately 570~ns of FHPD sampling for a total of 3.2~${\mu}s$ of 
simulation used in the milestoning model. The total cost per ligand (including 
simulation discarded for equilibration) was therefore $\sim$3.8 ${\mu}s$.
