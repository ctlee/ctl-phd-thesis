	\caption{Convergence analysis for a representative ligand,  aspirin, and \bcd with the Q4MD forcefield. Convergence of a) \kon, b) \koff,  c) transition counts, and d) incubation times for each milestone are plotted as a function of the number of reversals launched.  Reversal number is directly related to the length of equilibrium sampling, as reversals were launched at 2 ns intervals from the equilibrium trajectory.}
