abstract = {MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X. It is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com.

Its popularity in the industry has risen rapidly. This review examines state-of-the-art PAMPA methods. The various covered topics include: different lipid formulations, the quantitative relationships between hexadecane, dioyleyoylphosphatidycholine and Double-Sink PAMPA measurements, the use of individual-well stirring, issues of ultraviolet sensitivity, timing strategies, reproducibility of measurements, the correct pH to perform the measurement to avoid aqueous boundary layer problems, the pKa(flux) method for determining intrinsic permeability coefficients and the cosolvent method for very insoluble molecules. Examples of the determination of permeability of very difficult molecules, but molecules that are well absorbed, are given. Carefully gathered evidence in support of the use of the Double-Sink PAMPA model is presented. The review concludes with a binning strategy to predict human intestinal absorption, based on the use of the sum of permeability coefficients, measured at gradient pH 5.0, 6.2 and 7.4. Opinions regarding the future of PAMPA are offered.},

First, the different routes of drug transport in Caco-2 monolayers are compared with those seen in vivo. Second, the prediction of drug absorption in vivo from transport experiments in cell monolayers is discussed for different classes of drugs. Finally, the use of Caco-2 monolayers as a reference model in physico-chemical and theoretical predictions of drug absorption is discussed. We conclude that Caco-2 monolayers can be used to identify drugs with potential absorption problems, and possibly also to select drugs with optimal passive absorption characteristics from series of pharmacologically active molecules generated in drug discovery programs. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{VanBreemen2005,
abstract = {Caco-2 cells are a human colon epithelial cancer cell line used as a model of human intestinal absorption of drugs and other compounds. When cultured as a monolayer, Caco-2 cells differentiate to form tight junctions between cells to serve as a model of paracellular movement of compounds across the monolayer. In addition, Caco-2 cells express transporter proteins, efflux proteins, and Phase II conjugation enzymes to model a variety of transcellular pathways as well as metabolic transformation of test substances. In many respects, the Caco-2 cell monolayer mimics the human intestinal epithelium. One of the functional differences between normal cells and Caco-2 cells is the lack of expression of the cytochrome P450 isozymes and in particular, CYP3A4, which is normally expressed at high levels in the intestine. However, Caco-2 cells may be induced to express higher levels of CYP3A4 by treatment with vitamin D3. Caco-2 cell monolayers are usually cultured on semipermeable plastic supports that may be fitted into the wells of multi-well culture plates. Test compounds are then added to either the apical or basolateral sides of the monolayer. After incubation for various lengths of time, aliquots of the buffer in opposite chambers are removed for the determination of the concentration of test compounds and the computation of the rates of permeability for each compound (called the apparent permeability coefficients). Although radiolabelled compounds were used in the original Caco-2 cells monolayer assays, radiolabelled compounds have been replaced in most laboratories by the use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and LC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Mass spectrometry not only eliminates the need for radiolabelled compounds, but permits the simultaneous measurement of multiple compounds. The measurement of multiple compounds per assay reduces the number of incubations that need to be carried out, thereby increasing the throughput of the experiments. Furthermore, LC-MS and LC-MS-MS add another dimension to Caco-2 assays by facilitating the investigation of the metabolism of compounds by Caco-2 cells.},

The development of computational models to predict small molecule membrane permeability is therefore of considerable scientific and public health interest. Empirical qualitative structure permeability relationship models of permeability have been a mainstay in industrial applications, but lack a deep understanding of the underlying biologic physics. Others and we have shown that implicit solvent models to predict passive permeability for small molecules exhibit mediocre predictive performance when validated across experimental test sets. Given the vast increase in computer power, more efficient parallelization schemes, and extension of current atomistic simulation codes to general use graphical processing units, the development and application of physical models based on all-atom simulations may now be feasible. Preliminary results from rigorous free energy calculations using all-atom simulations indicate that performance relative to implicit solvent models may be improved, but many outstanding questions remain. Here, we review the current state-of-the-art physical models for passive membrane permeability prediction and present a prospective look at promising new directions for all-atom approaches.},

abstract = {Designing tight-binding ligands is a primary objective of small-molecule drug discovery. Over the past few decades, free-energy calculations have benefited from improved force fields and sampling algorithms, as well as the advent of low-cost parallel computing. However, it has proven to be challenging to reliably achieve the level of accuracy that would be needed to guide lead optimization (â¼5Ã in binding affinity) for a wide range of ligands and protein targets. Not surprisingly, widespread commercial application of free-energy simulations has been limited due to the lack of large-scale validation coupled with the technical challenges traditionally associated with running these types of calculations. Here, we report an approach that achieves an unprecedented level of accuracy across a broad range of target classes and ligands, with retrospective results encompassing 200 ligands and a wide variety of chemical perturbations, many of which involve significant changes in ligand chemical structures. In addition, we have applied the method in prospective drug discovery projects and found a significant improvement in the quality of the compounds synthesized that have been predicted to be potent. Compounds predicted to be potent by this approach have a substantial reduction in false positives relative to compounds synthesized on the basis of other computational or medicinal chemistry approaches. Furthermore, the results are consistent with those obtained from our retrospective studies, demonstrating the robustness and broad range of applicability of this approach, which can be used to drive decisions in lead optimization.},

With this development, the ability of force fields to successfully predict relaxation timescales and the associated conformational exchange processes moves into focus. We assess to what extent the dynamic properties of model peptides (Ac-A-NHMe, Ac-V-NHMe, AVAVA, A10) differ when simulated with different force fields (AMBER ff99SB-ILDN, AMBER ff03, OPLS-AA/L, CHARMM27, and GROMOS43a1). The dynamic properties are extracted using Markov state models. For single-residue models (Ac-A-NHMe, Ac-V-NHMe), the slow conformational exchange processes are similar in all force fields, but the associated relaxation timescales differ by up to an order of magnitude. For the peptide systems, not only the relaxation timescales, but also the conformational exchange processes differ considerably across force fields. This finding calls the significance of dynamic interpretations of molecular-dynamics simulations into question.},

@article{Finkelstein1968,
abstract = {We present and discuss the permeability and electrical properties of thin lipid membranes, and the changes induced in these properties by several agents added to the aqueous phases after the membranes have formed. The unmodified membrane is virtually impermeable to ions and small "hydrophilic" solutes, but relatively permeable to water and "lipophilic" molecules. These properties are consistent with those predicted for a thin film of hydrocarbon through which matter is transported by dissolving in the membrane phase and then diffusing through it. The effect of cholesterol in reducing the water and "lipophilic" solute permeability is attributed to an increase of the "viscosity" of the hydrocarbon region, thus reducing the diffusion coefficient of molecules within this phase. The selective permeability of the membrane to iodide (I(-)) in the presence of iodine (I(2)) is attributed to the formation of polyiodides (perhaps I(5) (-)), which are presumed to be relatively soluble in the membrane because of their large size, and hence lower surface charge density. Thus, I(2) acts as a carrier for I(-). The effects of "excitability-inducing material" and the depsipeptides (particularly valinomycin) on ion permeability are reviewed. The effects of the polyene antibiotics (nystatin and amphotericin B) on ion permeability, discussed in greater detail, are the following: (a) membrane conductance increases with the 10th power of nystatin concentration; (b) the membrane is anion-selective but does not discriminate completely between anions and cations; (c) the membrane discriminates among anions on the basis of size; (d) membrane conductance decreases extraordinarily with increasing temperatures. Valinomycin and nystatin form independent conductance pathways in the same membrane, and, in the presence of both, the membrane can be reversibly shifted between a cation and anion permeable state by changes in temperature. It is suggested that nystatin produces pores in the membrane and valinomycin acts as a carrier.},

abstract = {Nonelectrolyte partition coefficients (K) and free energies of solution (?F(i)s) in dimyristoyl lecithin liposomes and in bulk nonpolar solvents were compared. Individual substituent groups tend to have consistent effects on K, permitting the extraction of incremental free energies (??F), enthalpies (??H), and entropies (??S) of partition and of solution. Values of the selectivity constant s and of ??F(i) for the -CH2- and -OH groups in lecithin suggest that partitioned solutes are mainly located in a region slightly less hydrophobic than octanol and similar to C5H11OH in its solvent properties. Lecithin discriminates against branched solutes more than does a bulk solvent with the same s value. Below the endothermic phase transition temperature (i.e., when the hydrocarbon tails 'freeze'), ?S and ?H of partition increase 10 fold, K jumps down slightly, ?S and ?H of solution reverse in sign from negative to positive, and the Barclay Butler constants become more positive. Partition in lecithin and in erythrocytes is similar, except for the absence of surface charge effects in lecithin. Resistance to nonelectrolyte permeation is inhomogeneously distributed through the bilayer, and the region of maximum partition does not provide the rate limiting barrier. An appendix derives a simple general expression for the nonelectrolyte permeability of a membrane that may be asymmetrical, may have position dependent partition coefficients and diffusion coefficients, and may have significant interfacial resistances.},

@article{Marrink1994,
abstract = {To obtain insight in the process of water permeation through a lipid membrane, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on a phospholipid (DPPC)/water system with atomic detail. Since the actual process of permeation is too slow to be studied directly, we deduced the permeation rate indirectly via computation of the free energy and diffusion rate profiles of a water molecule across the bilayer. We conclude that the permeation of water through a lipid membrane cannot be described adequately by a simple homogeneous solubility-diffusion model. Both the excess free energy and the diffusion rate strongly depend on the position in the membrane, as a result from the inhomogeneous nature of the membrane. The calculated excess free energy profile has a shallow slope and a maximum height of 26 kJ/mol. The diffusion rate is highest in the middle of the membrane where the lipid density is low. In the interfacial region almost all water molecules are bound by the lipid headgroups, and the diffusion turns out to be 1 order of magnitude smaller. The total transport process is essentially determined by the free energy barrier. The rate-limiting step is the permeation through the dense part of the lipid tails, where the resistance is highest. We found a permeation rate of 7(Â±3) Ã 10-2 cm/s at 350 K, comparable to experimental values for DPPC membranes, if corrected for the temperature of the simulation. Taking the inhomogeneity of the membrane into account, we define a new "four-region" model which seems to be more realistic than the "two-phase" solubility-diffusion model.

abstract = {The efficiencies of two recently developed methods for calculating free energy changes along a generalized coordinate in a system are discussed in the context of other, related approaches. One method is based on Jarzynski's identity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997)]. The second method relies on thermodynamic integration of the average force and is called the adaptive biasing force method [Darve and Pohorille, J. Chem. Phys. 115, 9169 (2001)]. Both methods are designed such that the system evolves along the chosen coordinate(s) without experiencing free energy barriers and they require calculating the instantaneous, unconstrained force acting on this coordinate using the formula derived by Darve and Pohorille. Efficiencies are analyzed by comparing analytical estimates of statistical errors and by considering two numerical examples-internal rotation of hydrated 1,2-dichloroethane and transfer of fluoromethane across a water-hexane interface. The efficiencies of both methods are approximately equal in the first but not in the second case. During transfer of fluoromethane the system is easily driven away from equilibrium and, therefore, the performance of the method based on Jarzynski's identity is poor.},

@article{Darve2001,
abstract = {A new, general formula that connects the derivatives of the free energy along the selected, generalized coordinates of the system with the instantaneous force acting on these coordinates is derived. The instantaneous force is defined as the force acting on the coordinate of interest so that when it is subtracted from the equations of motion the acceleration along this coordinate is zero. The formula applies to simulations in which the selected coordinates are either unconstrained or constrained to fixed values. It is shown that in the latter case the formula reduces to the expression previously derived by den Otter and Briels [Mol. Phys. 98, 773 (2000)]. If simulations are carried out without constraining the coordinates of interest, the formula leads to a new method for calculating the free energy changes along these coordinates. This method is tested in two examplesââârotation around the CâC bond of 1,2-dichloroethane immersed in water and transfer of fluoromethane across the water-hexane interface. The calculated free energies are compared with those obtained by two commonly used methods. One of them relies on determining the probability density function of finding the system at different values of the selected coordinate and the other requires calculating the average force at discrete locations along this coordinate in a series of constrained simulations. The free energies calculated by these three methods are in excellent agreement. The relative advantages of each method are discussed.},

@article{Darve2008a,
abstract = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in N-acetylalanyl-N'-methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

@article{Wei2011,
abstract = {Elucidating mechanisms that facilitate primordial synthesis of information polymers is central to understanding the origins of life. One such mechanism might have been the recently discovered diastereoselectivity of membranes favoring uptake of ribose (Sacerdote, M. G.; Szostak, J. W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005, 102, 6004), which might have promoted its preferential incorporation into nucleic acids. To determine whether the same mechanism was available if nucleosides rather than sugars were supplied to ancestral cells, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations of their permeation through a lipid bilayer. We find that the free energy barriers to permeation of ribo-adenosine and arabino-adenosine through the 1-palmitoyl- 2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine membrane are quite similar, equal to 10.0 and 10.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The corresponding permeability coefficients are also similar, equal to 9.1 Ã 10(-7) and 5.3 Ã 10(-7) cm/s. The 10-fold increase in permeability of membranes to ribose over its diastereomers is not preserved for nucleosides because in contrast to free aldopentoses they exist in the furanose rather than pyranose form. This change eliminates the possibility of forming a network of favorable, intramolecular interactions between exocyclic, hydroxyl groups that stabilizes ribose, but not its diastereomers, inside membranes. Thus, uptake of nutrients provided selective advantage to primordial RNA only if the species absorbed through cell walls were sugars rather than nucleosides.},

Such methods are also likely to be directly applicable to the design and optimization of liposomal delivery systems. MD simulations are particularly valuable in addressing issues that are difficult to explore in laboratory experiments due to the heterogeneity of lipid bilayer membranes at the molecular level. Insights emerging from MD simulations are contributing to an understanding of which regions within bilayers are most and least favored by solutes at equilibrium as the solute structure is varied, local diffusivities of permeants, and the origin of the amplified selectivity to permeant size imposed by lipid bilayer membranes, particularly as changes in composition increase acyl chain ordering.},

We calculate spatially resolved free energy profiles and local diffusion coefficients using the distance between the bilayer and valproic acid respective centers-of-mass along the bilayer normal as reaction coordinate. To investigate the pH dependence, we calculate profiles for the neutral valproic acid as well as its water-soluble anionic conjugate base valproate. The local diffusion constants for valproate/valproic acid along the bilayer normal are found to be approximately 10(-6) to 10(-5) cm2 s(-1). Assuming protonation of valproic acid upon association with--or insertion into--the lipid bilayer, we calculate the permeation coefficient to be approximately 2.0 10(-3) cm s(-1), consistent with recent experimental estimates of fast fatty acid transport.

abstract = {Studies of insertion and interactions of amino acids in lipid membranes are pivotal to our understanding of membrane protein structure and function. Calculating the insertion cost as a function of transmembrane helix sequence is thus an important step towards improved membrane protein prediction and eventually drug design. Here, we present position-dependent free energies of solvation for all amino acid analogs along the membrane normal. The profiles cover the entire region from bulk water to hydrophobic core, and were produced from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Experimental differences corresponding to mutations and costs for entire segments match experimental data well, and in addition the profiles provide the spatial resolution currently not available from experiments. Polar side-chains largely maintain their hydration and assume quite ordered conformations, which indicates the solvation cost is mainly entropic. The cost of solvating charged side-chains is not only significantly lower than for implicit solvation models, but also close to experiments, meaning these could well maintain their protonation states inside the membrane. The single notable exception to the experimental agreement is proline, which is quite expensive to introduce in vivo despite its hydrophobicity--a difference possibly explained by kinks making it harder to insert helices in the translocon.},

abstract = {We have calculated the distribution in a lipid bilayer of small molecules mimicking 17 natural amino acids in atomistic detail by molecular dynamics simulation. We considered both charged and uncharged forms for Lys, Arg, Glu, and Asp. The results give detailed insight in the molecular basis of the preferred location and orientation of each side chain as well the preferred charge state for ionizable residues. Partitioning of charged and polar side chains is accompanied by water defects connecting the side chains to bulk water. These water defects dominate the energetic of partitioning, rather than simple partitioning between water and a hydrophobic phase. Lys, Glu, and Asp become uncharged well before reaching the center of the membrane, but Arg may be either charged or uncharged at the center of the membrane. Phe has a broad distribution in the membrane but Trp and Tyr localize strongly to the interfacial region. The distributions are useful for the development of coarse-grained and implicit membrane potentials for simulation and structure prediction. We discuss the relationship between the distribution in membranes, bulk partitioning to cyclohexane, and several amino acid hydrophobicity scales.},

abstract = {Atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) bilayers containing small, amphiphilic, drug-like molecules were carried out to examine the influence of polar functionality on membrane partitioning and transport. Three related molecules (tyramine, phenethylamine, and 4-ethylphenol) were chosen to allow a detailed study of the isolated effects of the amine and hydroxyl functionalities on the preferred solute location, free energies of transfer, and the effect of combining both functional groups in a same molecule. Transfer free energy profiles (from water) generated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a function of bilayer depth compared favorably to comparable experimental results. The simulations allowed the determination of the location of the barrier domain for permeability where the transfer free energy is highest and the preferred binding region at which the free energy is a minimum for each of the three solutes. Comparisons of the free energy profiles reveal that the hydrocarbon chain interior is the region most selective to chemical structure of different solutes because the free energies of transfer in that region vary to a significantly greater extent than in other regions of the bilayer. The contributions of the hydroxyl and amino groups to the free energies of solute transfer from water to the interfacial region were close to zero in both the MD simulations and experimental measurements. This suggests that the free energy decrease observed for solute transfer into the head group region occurs with minimal loss in solvation by hydrogen bonding to polar functional groups on the solute and is largely driven by hydrophobicity. Overall, the joint experimental and simulation studies suggest that the assumption of additivity of free energy contributions from multiple polar functional groups on the same molecule may hold for predictions of passive bilayer permeability coefficients providing that the groups are well isolated. However, this assumption does not hold for predictions of relative liposome-binding affinities.},

abstract = {Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of druglike molecules embedded in lipid bilayers are of considerable interest as models for drug penetration and positioning in biological membranes. Here we analyze partitioning of coumarin in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer, based on both multiple, unbiased 3 $\mu$s MD simulations (total length) and free energy profiles along the bilayer normal calculated by biased MD simulations (â¼7 $\mu$s in total). The convergences in time of free energy profiles calculated by both umbrella sampling and z-constraint techniques are thoroughly analyzed. Two sets of starting structures are also considered, one from unbiased MD simulation and the other from "pulling" coumarin along the bilayer normal. The structures obtained by pulling simulation contain water defects on the lipid bilayer surface, while those acquired from unbiased simulation have no membrane defects. The free energy profiles converge more rapidly when starting frames from unbiased simulations are used. In addition, z-constraint simulation leads to more rapid convergence than umbrella sampling, due to quicker relaxation of membrane defects. Furthermore, we show that the choice of RESP, PRODRG, or Mulliken charges considerably affects the resulting free energy profile of our model drug along the bilayer normal. We recommend using z-constraint biased MD simulations based on starting geometries acquired from unbiased MD simulations for efficient calculation of convergent free energy profiles of druglike molecules along bilayer normals. The calculation of free energy profile should start with an unbiased simulation, though the polar molecules might need a slow pulling afterward. Results obtained with the recommended simulation protocol agree well with available experimental data for two coumarin derivatives.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by specialized tight junctions between endothelial cells that line brain capillaries to create a highly selective barrier between the brain and the rest of the body. A major problem to overcome in drug design is the ability of the compound in question to cross the BBB. Neuroactive drugs are required to cross the BBB to function. Conversely, drugs that target other parts of the body ideally should not cross the BBB to avoid possible psychotropic side effects. Thus, the task of predicting the BBB permeability of new compounds is of great importance. Two gold-standard experimental measures of BBB permeability are logBB (the concentration of drug in the brain divided by concentration in the blood) and logPS (permeability surface-area product). Both methods are time-consuming and expensive, and although logPS is considered the more informative measure, it is lower throughput and more resource intensive. With continual increases in computer power and improvements in molecular simulations, in silico methods may provide viable alternatives. Computational predictions of these two parameters for a sample of 12 small molecule compounds were performed. The potential of mean force for each compound through a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer is determined by molecular dynamics simulations. This system setup is often used as a simple BBB mimetic. Additionally, one-dimensional position-dependent diffusion coefficients are calculated from the molecular dynamics trajectories. The diffusion coefficient is combined with the free energy landscape to calculate the effective permeability (Peff) for each sample compound. The relative values of these permeabilities are compared to experimentally determined logBB and logPS values. Our computational predictions correlate remarkably well with both logBB (R2 = 0.94) and logPS (R2 = 0.90). Thus, we have demonstrated that this approach may have the potential to provide reliable, quantitatively predictive BBB permeability, using a relatively quick, inexpensive method.

@article{Issack2015,
abstract = {While it has long been known that cholesterol reduces the permeability of biological membranes to water, the exact mechanism by which cholesterol influences transmembrane permeation is still unclear. The thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the transport of water across mixed DPPC/cholesterol bilayers of different composition are thus examined by molecular dynamics simulations. Our analyses show that cholesterol decreases transmembrane permeability to water mainly by altering the thermodynamics of water transport. In particular, the free energy barrier to permeation is magnified in the dense bilayer interior and the partitioning of water is significantly lowered. The changes are observed to correlate quantitatively well with the cholesterol-dependent density and thickness of the bilayers. In contrast, diffusion coefficients are relatively insensitive to cholesterol concentration, except in the sparsely populated centre of the bilayer. Diffusion of water in cholesterol-containing bilayers appears to be related to changes in the free area in the middle of the bilayer and to the solute cross-sectional area in the denser hydrophobic regions. Overall, cholesterol is found to have an inhibitory effect on the permeation of water at all concentrations investigated although bilayers containing cholesterol concentrations up to 20 mol{\%} display a more dramatic dependence on cholesterol content than at higher concentrations. Our results show that it is possible to quantitatively reproduce the relative effects of cholesterol on lipid bilayer permeability from molecular dynamics simulations.},

@article{Bemporad2005,
abstract = {To reach their biological target, drugs have to cross cell membranes, and understanding passive membrane permeation is therefore crucial for rational drug design. Molecular dynamics simulations offer a powerful way of studying permeation at the single molecule level. Starting from a computer model proven to be able to reproduce the physical properties of a biological membrane, the behaviour of small solutes and large drugs in a lipid bilayer has been studied. Analysis of dihedral angles shows that a few nanosesconds are sufficient for the simulations to converge towards common values for those angles, even if the starting structures belong to different conformations. Results clearly show that, despite their difference in size, small solutes and large drugs tend to lie parallel to the bilayer normal and that, when moving from water solution into biomembranes, permeants lose degrees of freedom. This explains the experimental observation that partitioning and permeation are highly affected by entropic effects and are size-dependent. Tilted orientations, however, occur when they make possible the formation of hydrogen bonds. This helps to understand the reason why hydrogen bonding possibilities are an important parameter in cruder approaches which predict drug absorption after administration. Interestingly, hydration is found to occur even in the membrane core, which is usually considered an almost hydrophobic region. Simulations suggest the possibility for highly polar compounds like acetic acid to cross biological membranes while hydrated. These simulations prove useful for drug design in rationalising experimental observations and predicting solute behaviour in biomembranes. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Calculations of lipid bilayer permeabilities from first principles, using molecular simulations, would be valuable to rapidly assess the bioavailability of drug candidates, as well as to decipher, at the atomic level, the mechanisms that underlie the translocation of permeants. The most common theoretical approach, the solubilityâdiffusion model, requires determination of the free energy and the diffusivity as functions of the position of the permeant. Quantitative predictions of permeability have, however, been stymied by acute difficulties in calculating the diffusivity, inadequate sampling, and, most insidiously, systematic biases due to imperfections in the force field, simulation parameters, and the inherent limitations of the diffusive model. In the present work, we combine importance-sampling simulations employing an adaptive biasing force with a Bayesian-inference algorithm to determine the free energy and diffusivity with noteworthy precision and spatial resolution. In multimicrosecond simulations, we probe the sensitivity of the permeability estimates to different aspects of the methodology, including the truncation of short-range interactions, the thermostat, the force-field parameters of the permeant, the time scale over which the diffusivity is estimated, and the size of the simulated system. The force-field parameters and time scale dependence of the diffusivities impose the greatest uncertainties on the permeability estimates. Our simulations highlight the importance of membrane distortion due to the presence of the permeant, which may be partially suppressed if the bilayer patch is not large enough. We suggest that improvements to force fields and more robust kinetic models may be needed to reduce systematic errors below a factor of two.},

This allows deriving an accurate picture of the permeation process, and constructing a detailed molecular model of the transition state, making a rational control of permeation properties possible. We benchmarked this approach on the permeation of ethanol molecules through a POPC membrane, showing that the value of P calculated with our model agrees with the one calculated by a long unbiased molecular dynamics of the same system.},

abstract = {Milestoning is a procedure to compute the time evolution of complicated processes such as barrier crossing events or long diffusive transitions between predefined states. Milestoning reduces the dynamics to transition events between intermediates (the milestones) and computes the local kinetic information to describe these transitions via short molecular dynamics (MD) runs between the milestones. The procedure relies on the ability to reinitialize MD trajectories on the milestones to get the right kinetic information about the transitions. It also rests on the assumptions that the transition events between successive milestones and the time lags between these transitions are statistically independent. In this paper, we analyze the validity of these assumptions. We show that sets of optimal milestones exist, i.e., sets such that successive transitions are indeed statistically independent. The proof of this claim relies on the results of transition path theory and uses the isocommittor surfaces of the reaction as milestones. For systems in the overdamped limit, we also obtain the probability distribution to reinitialize the MD trajectories on the milestones, and we discuss why this distribution is not available in closed form for systems with inertia. We explain why the time lags between transitions are not statistically independent even for optimal milestones, but we show that working with such milestones allows one to compute mean first passage times between milestones exactly. Finally, we discuss some practical implications of our results and we compare milestoning with Markov state models in view of our findings.},

@article{Majek2010,
abstract = {Milestoning is a method for calculating kinetics and thermodynamics of long time processes typically not accessible for straightforward Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. In the Milestoning approach, the system of interest is partitioned into cells by dividing hypersurfaces (Milestones) and transitions are computed between nearby hypersurfaces. Kinetics and thermodynamics are derived from the statistics of these transitions. The original Milestoning work concentrated on systems in which a one-dimensional reaction coordinate or an order parameter could be identified. In many biomolecular processes the reaction proceeds via multiple channels or following more than a single order parameter. A description based on a one-dimensional reaction coordinate may be insufficient. In the present paper we introduce a variation that overcomes this limitation.Following the ideas of Vanden-Eijnden and Venturoli on Voronoi cells that avoid the use of an order parameter (J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 194101), we describe another way to "Milestone" systems without a reaction coordinate. We examine the assumptions of the Milestoning calculations of mean first passage times (MFPT) and describe strategies to weaken these assumptions. The method described in this paper, Directional Milestoning, arranges hypersurfaces in higher dimensions that "tag" trajectories such that efficient calculations can be done and at the same time the assumptions required for exact calculations of MFPTs are satisfied approximately.In the original Milestoning papers trajectories are initiated from an equilibrium set of conformations. Here a more accurate distribution, that mimics the first hitting point distribution, is used. We demonstrate the usage of Directional Milestoning in conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide (in vacuum and in aqueous solution) and compare the correctness, efficiency, and statistical stability of the method with exact MD and with a related method.},

abstract = {A new theory and an exact computer algorithm for calculating kinetics and thermodynamic properties of a particle system are described. The algorithm avoids trapping in metastable states, which are typical challenges for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on rough energy landscapes. It is based on the division of the full space into Voronoi cells. Prior knowledge or coarse sampling of space points provides the centers of the Voronoi cells. Short time trajectories are computed between the boundaries of the cells that we call milestones and are used to determine fluxes at the milestones. The flux function, an essential component of the new theory, provides a complete description of the statistical mechanics of the system at the resolution of the milestones. We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the exact Milestoning approach by comparing numerical results obtained on a model system using exact Milestoning with the results of long trajectories and with a solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. The theory uses an equation that resembles the approximate Milestoning method that was introduced in 2004 [A. K. Faradjian and R. Elber, J. Chem. Phys. 120(23), 10880-10889 (2004)]. However, the current formulation is exact and is still significantly more efficient than straightforward MD simulations on the system studied.},

The space of the membrane system is divided into cells and the different cells are characterized by order parameters presenting the number densities. The dynamics of the order parameters are probed with Milestoning. The methodology is illustrated here for a phospholipid membrane system (a hydrated bilayer of DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) lipid molecules). Significant inhomogeneity in membrane internal number density leads to complex free energy landscape and local maps of transition times. Dynamics and distributions of cavities within the membrane assist the permeation of nonpolar solutes such as xenon atoms. It is illustrated that quantitative and detailed dynamics of water transport through DOPC membrane can be analyzed using Milestoning with fields.

abstract = {In recent years, atomistic molecular simulations have become a method of choice for studying the interaction of small molecules, peptides, and proteins with biological membranes. Here, we critically examine the statistical convergence of equilibrium properties in molecular simulations of two amino acid side-chain analogs, leucine and arginine, in the presence of a hydrated phospholipid bilayer. To this end, the convergence of the standard binding free energy for the reversible insertion of the solutes in the bilayer is systematically assessed by evaluating dozens of separate sets of umbrella sampling calculations for a total simulation time exceeding 400 ?s. We identify rare and abrupt transitions in bilayer structure as a function of solute insertion depth. These transitions correspond to the slow reorganization of ionic interactions involving zwitterionic phospholipid headgroups when the solutes penetrate the lipid?water interface and when arginine is forced through the bilayer center. These rare events are shown to constitute hidden sampling barriers that limit the rate of convergence of equilibrium properties and result in systematic sampling errors. Our analysis demonstrates that the difficulty of attaining convergence for lipid bilayer-embedded solutes has, in general, been drastically underestimated. This information will assist future studies in improving accuracy by selecting a more appropriate reaction coordinate or by focusing computational resources on those regions of the reaction coordinate that exhibit slow convergence of equilibrium properties.

All methods were first tested and compared for K(+) in bulk water--all predicted the correct diffusion constant. Inside GA, MSD and VACF methods were found to be unreliable because they are biased by the systematic force exerted by the membrane-channel system on the ion. SFDT and GLE-HO techniques properly unbias the influence of the systematic force on the diffusion properties and predicted a similar diffusion constant of K(+) inside GA, namely, ca. 10 times smaller than in the bulk. It was found that both SFDT and GLE-HO methods require extensive MD sampling on the order of tens of nanoseconds to predict a reliable diffusion constant of K(+) inside GA.},

abstract = {The Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) is a standard technique used to compute potentials of mean force (PMFs) from a set of umbrella sampling simulations. Here, we present a new WHAM implementation, termed g{\_}wham, which is distributed freely with the GROMACS molecular simulation suite. g{\_}wham estimates statistical errors using the technique of bootstrap analysis. Three bootstrap methods are supported: (i) bootstrapping new trajectories based on the umbrella histograms, (ii) bootstrapping of complete histograms, and (iii) Bayesian bootstrapping of complete histograms, that is, bootstrapping via the assignment of random weights to the histograms. Because methods ii and iii consider only complete histograms as independent data points, these methods do not require the accurate calculation of autocorrelation times. We demonstrate that, given sufficient sampling, bootstrapping new trajectories allows for an accurate error estimate. In the presence of long autocorrelations, however, (Bayesian) bootstrapping of complete histograms yields a more reliable error estimate, whereas bootstrapping of new trajectories may underestimate the error. In addition, we emphasize that the incorporation of autocorrelations into WHAM reduces the bias from limited sampling, in particular, when computing periodic PMFs in inhomogeneous systems such as solvated lipid membranes or protein channels.

Here, we present a new WHAM implementation, termed g{\_}wham, which is distributed freely with the GROMACS molecular simulation suite. g{\_}wham estimates statistical errors using the technique of bootstrap analysis. Three bootstrap methods are supported: (i) bootstrapping new trajectories based on the umbrella histograms, (ii) bootstrapping of complete histograms, and (iii) Bayesian bootstrapping of complete histograms, that is, bootstrapping via the assignment of random weights to the histograms. Because methods ii and iii consider only complete histograms as independent data points, these methods do not require the accurate calculation of autocorrelation times. We demonstrate that, given sufficient sampling, bootstrapping new trajectories allows for an accurate error estimate. In the presence of long autocorrelations, however, (Bayesian) bootstrapping of complete histograms yields a more reliable error estimate, whereas bootstrapping of new trajectories may underestimate the error. In addition, we emphasize that the incorporation of autocorrelations into WHAM reduces the bias from limited sampling, in particular, when computing periodic PMFs in inhomogeneous systems such as solvated lipid membranes or protein channels.},

abstract = {Currently used techniques for the analysis of single-molecule trajectories only exploit a small part of the available information stored in the data. Here, we apply a Bayesian inference scheme to trajectories of confined receptors that are targeted by pore-forming toxins to extract the two-dimensional confining potential that restricts the motion of the receptor. The receptor motion is modeled by the overdamped Langevin equation of motion. The method uses most of the information stored in the trajectory and converges quickly onto inferred values, while providing the uncertainty on the determined values. The inference is performed on the polynomial development of the potential and on the diffusivities that have been discretized on a mesh. Numerical simulations are used to test the scheme and quantify the convergence toward the input values for forces, potential, and diffusivity. Furthermore, we show that the technique outperforms the classical mean-square-displacement technique when forces act on confined molecules because the typical mean-square-displacement analysis does not account for them. We also show that the inferred potential better represents input potentials than the potential extracted from the position distribution based on Boltzmann statistics that assumes statistical equilibrium.},

abstract = {Accurate calculation of permeabilities from first-principles has been a long-standing challenge for computer simulations, notably in the context of drug discovery, as a route to predict the propensity of small, organic molecules to spontaneously translocate biological membranes. Of equal importance is the understanding of the permeation process and the pathway followed by the permeant from the aqueous medium to the interior of the lipid bilayer, and back out again. A convenient framework for the computation of permeabilities is provided by the solubility?diffusion model, which requires knowledge of the underlying free-energy and diffusivity landscapes. Here, we develop a formalism that includes an explicit description of the orientational motion of the solute as it diffuses across the membrane. Toward this end, we have generalized a recently proposed method that reconciles thermodynamics and kinetics in importance-sampling simulations by means of a Bayesian-inference scheme to reverse-solve the underlying Smoluchowski equation. Performance of the proposed formalism is examined in the model cases of a water and an ethanol molecule crossing a fully hydrated lipid bilayer. Our analysis reveals a conspicuous dependence of the free-energy and rotational diffusivity on the orientation of ethanol when it lies within the headgroup region of the bilayer. Specifically, orientations for which the hydroxyl group lies among the polar lipid head groups, while the ethyl group recedes toward the hydrophobic interior are associated with free-energy minima ?2kBT deep, as well as significantly slower orientational kinetics compared to the bulk solution or the core of the bilayer. The conspicuous orientational anisotropy of ethanol at the aqueous interface is suggestive of a complete rotation of the permeant as it crosses the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.

In this work, we describe the new features and major improvements in Membrane Builder that allow users to robustly build realistic biological membrane systems, including (1) addition of new lipid types, such as phosphoinositides, cardiolipin (CL), sphingolipids, bacterial lipids, and ergosterol, yielding more than 180 lipid types, (2) enhanced building procedure for lipid packing around protein, (3) reliable algorithm to detect lipid tail penetration to ring structures and protein surface, (4) distance-based algorithm for faster initial ion displacement, (5) CHARMM inputs for P21 image transformation, and (6) NAMD equilibration and production inputs. The robustness of these new features is illustrated by building and simulating a membrane model of the polar and septal regions of E. coli membrane, which contains five lipid types: CL lipids with two types of acyl chains and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids with three types of acyl chains. It is our hope that CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder becomes a useful tool for simulation studies to better understand the structure and dynamics of proteins and lipids in realistic biological membrane environments.

abstract = {Mechanisms and underlying thermodynamic determinants of translocation of charged cationic peptides such as cell-penetrating peptides across the cellular membrane continue to receive much attention. Two widely held views include endocytotic and non-endocytotic (diffusive) processes of permeant transfer across the bilayer. Considering a purely diffusive process, we consider the free energetics of translocation of a monoarginine peptide mimic across a model DMPC bilayer. We compute potentials of mean force for the transfer of a charged monoarginine peptide unit from water to the center of a 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) model lipid bilayer. We use fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations coupled with the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method for free energy estimation. The estimated potential of mean force difference from bulk to bilayer center is 6.94 Â± 0.28 kcal/mol. The order of magnitude of this prediction is consistent with past experimental estimates of arginine partitioning into physiological bilayers in the context of translocon-based experiments, though the correlation between the bench and computer experiments is not unambiguous. Moreover, the present value is roughly one-half of previous estimates based on all-atom molecular dynamics free energy calculations. We trace the differences between the present and earlier calculations to system sizes used in the simulations and the dependence of the contributions to the free energy from various system components (water, lipids, ions, peptide) on overall system size. By varying the bilayer lateral dimensions in simulations using only sufficient numbers of counterions to maintain overall system charge neutrality, we find the possibility of an inherent convergent transfer free energy value.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18{\%} overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygenâoxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for selfâdiffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

abstract = {A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2{\%}, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (S(CD)) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the S(CD) for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of (13)C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field.

 results of various tests on the analogous system to the dissipative ideal gas. We show that with an

Existing derivations of WHAM require observations to be discretized into a finite number of bins. Yet, WHAM formulas seem to hold even if the bin sizes are made arbitrarily small. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate both the validity and value of the multi-state Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) method seen as a binless extension of WHAM. We discuss two statistical arguments to derive the MBAR equations, in parallel to the self-consistency and maximum likelihood derivations already known for WHAM. We show that the binless method, like WHAM, can be used not only to estimate free energies and equilibrium expectations, but also to estimate equilibrium distributions. We also provide a number of useful results from the statistical literature, including the determination of MBAR estimators by minimization of a convex function. This leads to an approach to the computation of MBAR free energies by optimization algorithms, which can be more effective than existing algorithms. The advantages of MBAR are illustrated numerically for the calculation of absolute protein-ligand binding free energies by alchemical transformations with and without soft-core potentials. We show that binless statistical analysis can accurately treat sparsely distributed interaction energy samples as obtained from unmodified interaction potentials that cannot be properly analyzed using standard binning methods. This suggests that binless multi-state analysis of binding free energy simulations with unmodified potentials offers a straightforward alternative to the use of soft-core potentials for these alchemical transformations.},

abstract = {The growing adoption of generalized-ensemble algorithms for biomolecular simulation has resulted in a resurgence in the use of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to make use of all data generated by these simulations. Unfortunately, the original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not directly applicable to data generated by these methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine data from independent samplings of the canonical ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting configurations generated from a parallel tempering simulation by temperature obscures the temporal correlation in the data and results in an improper treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in constructing the estimate of the density of states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions, that can be directly applied to several generalized ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering, parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated tempering. We present methods that explicitly capture the considerable temporal correlation in sequentially generated configurations using autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the method with a one-dimensional model system and then apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean force from parallel tempering simulations of the alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit solvent.

abstract = {The adaptive biasing force (ABF) scheme is a powerful molecular-dynamics based method for overcoming barriers of the free-energy landscape. Integration of the mean force measured along a chosen reaction coordinate (RC) yields the so-called potential of mean force (PMF). The RC is a coarse-grained description of the transition mechanism. The mean force is estimated by accruing and averaging the instantaneous force exerted on the system. The PMF is then used to bias the standard dynamics of the system in order to improve sampling in the RC. We show that faster exploration of the reaction pathway can be achieved by running multiple walkers in parallel and exchanging information at fixed intervals in the course of the simulation. Numerical experiments performed on the prototypical deca-alanine peptide demonstrate that the convergence properties of the free-energy calculation are globally improved through a more efficient exploration of compact configurations reflected in parallel valleys of the free-energy landscape. Diffusion along the RC is further enhanced by a selection mechanism, whereby far-reaching walkers are cloned, replacing less effective ones.

abstract = {From the most powerful supercomputers to multicore desktops and laptops, parallel computing architectures have been in the mainstream for some time. However, numerical schemes for calculating free energies in molecular systems that directly leverage this hardware paradigm, usually taking the form of multiple-replica strategies, are just now on the cusp of becoming standard practice. Here, we present a modification of the popular molecular dynamics program NAMD that is envisioned to facilitate the use of powerful multiple-replica strategies to improve ergodic sampling for a specific class of free-energy methods known as adaptive biasing force. We describe the software implementation in a so-called multiple-walker context, alongside the interface that makes the proposed approach accessible to the end users. We further evaluate the performance of the adaptive biasing force multiple-walker strategy for a model system, namely, the reversible folding of a short peptide, and show, in particular, in regions of the transition coordinate where convergence of the free-energy calculation is encumbered by hidden barriers, that the multiple-walker strategy can yield far more reliable results in appreciably less real time on parallel architectures, relative to standard, single-replica calculations.
