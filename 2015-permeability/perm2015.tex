%Outline
%Introduction (Chris L.)
%  *permeability - what is it good for?
%  *solubility-diffusion model (also mention alternative approaches like milestoning)
%  *prior results from other studies
%  *need for a more systematic comparison
%  *how we meet that need here
%

      \input{2015-permeability/intro}
%         \newpage

%Results
%  *rationale for the choice of permeants (Yi, Nelson, Chris T.)
%    -range of expected logPs, experimental data for real membranes (not just PAMPA)
%    -also explores force field reliability (codeine just run through paramchem for example)

%    Section: "Calculated permeabilities" (Yi, Nelson, Chris T.)
%      -the final, BEST logPs from each method at ~1-1.4 us each (Table 1)
%      -plots showing the comparison
%      -what are the errors?  (just numerically at this point)
%      -does increasing simulation time help?  (not really: case of urea)

%Section: "PMFs"  (JC, Conner)
%      -notable asymmetry across the membrane center (focus on urea)
%      -effect of making the US PMFs symmetric using g-wham, along with autocorrelation time estimates
%      -longer equilibration makes US converge more quickly
%      -comparison using data from z = (0,36) @ 20 ns/window vs. z = (-36,36) @ 10 ns/window

%    Section: "Diffusivities"  (Jeff, Chris C., Chris R.)
%       -details of two approaches
%       -notable "fudge factors" in each (timestep in Bayesian approach, integration cutoff in Langevin/Hummer method)
%       -using US windows for Hummer method vs. separate simulations with higher restraint
%       -can diffusivity ever really be known?  (hints at breakdown of solubility-diffusion model)

  %       \newpage

%    Section: "Comparison of the methods"  (JC)
%       -rate of convergence of PMFs
%       -each method's Dz with same PMF
%       -each method's PMF with same Dz
%       -does any method stand out?
%
%    Section: Error tolerance and robustness (Conner)
%       -modeling PMFs / D(z) using simple functions and limited data (e.g., just a couple of points along the curve)
%       -range of logPs obtained depending on uncertainty

%Conclusions  (JC?)
%  *difficulties that arise in the calculations - slow membrane reorganization, solute reorientation, etc.  (here and/or maybe intro?)
%  *what method to use, when, how to prepare?
%  *where best to invest limited computational time?
%  *how much sampling is really needed to get within a certain error?  (e.g., +/- 1 log unit)
%  *take home message: can MD ever be used to reliably predict permeabilities?
%    -is there a way to streamline the process for high throughput calculations?
