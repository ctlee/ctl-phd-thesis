abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) and related methods are close to becoming routine computational tools for drug discovery. Their main advantage is in explicitly treating structural flexibility and entropic effects. This allows a more accurate estimate of the thermodynamics and kinetics associated with drug–target recognition and binding, as better algorithms and hardware architectures increase their use. Here, we review the theoretical background of MD and enhanced sampling methods, focusing on free-energy perturbation, metadynamics, steered MD, and other methods most consistently used to study drug–target binding. We discuss unbiased MD simulations that nowadays allow the observation of unsupervised ligand–target binding, assessing how these approaches help optimizing target affinity and drug residence time toward improved drug efficacy. Further issues discussed include allosteric modulation and the role of water molecules in ligand binding and optimization. We conclude by calling for more prospective studies to ...},

The binding of drugs to their macromolecular targets is therefore seen as paramount for pharmacological activity. In vitro assessment of drug-target interactions is classically quantified in terms of binding parameters such as IC(50) or K(d). This article presents an alternative perspective on drug optimization in terms of drug-target binary complex residence time, as quantified by the dissociative half-life of the drug-target binary complex. We describe the potential advantages of long residence time in terms of duration of pharmacological effect and target selectivity.},

We present an algorithm to compute efficiently a sequence of isocommittor surfaces. These surfaces are considered an optimal reaction coordinate. The algorithm analyzes Milestoning results to determine the committor function. It requires only the transition probabilities between the milestones, and not transition times.

abstract = {Molecular mechanics is powerful for its speed in atomistic simulations, but an accurate force field is required. The Amber ff99SB force field improved protein secondary structure balance and dynamics from earlier force fields like ff99, but weaknesses in side chain rotamer and backbone secondary structure preferences have been identified. Here, we performed a complete refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which had been carried over from ff94. The training set of conformations included multidimensional dihedral scans designed to improve transferability of the parameters. Improvement in all amino acids was obtained as compared to ff99SB. Parameters were also generated for alternate protonation states of ionizable side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced 35{\%} from ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical adjustments to the protein backbone dihedral parameters as compared to ff99SB. Multiple small adjustments of $\phi$ and $\psi$ parameters were tested against NMR scalar coupling data and secondary structure content for short peptides. The best results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to the $\phi$ rotational profile that compensates for lack of ff99SB QM training data in the $\beta$-ppII transition region. Together, these backbone and side chain modifications (hereafter called ff14SB) not only better reproduced their benchmarks, but also improved secondary structure content in small peptides and reproduction of NMR $\chi$1 scalar coupling measurements for proteins in solution. We also discuss the Amber ff12SB parameter set, a preliminary version of ff14SB that includes most of its improvements.},

Lead optimization programs that in their quest for efficacy focus solely on improving the affinity of drug-target binding are flawed, since this approach ignores the fluctuations in drug concentration that occur in vivo. Instead the lifetime of the drug-target complex must also be considered, since drugs only act when they are bound to their targets.

abstract = {The mutation and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with the development of a variety of cancers, making this prototypical dimerization-activated receptor tyrosine kinase a prominent target of cancer drugs. Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the N lobe dimerization interface of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is intrinsically disordered and that it becomes ordered only upon dimerization. Our simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing activation without dimerization. We also find that phosphorylation of EGFR kinase domain at Tyr845 may suppress the intrinsic disorder, suggesting a molecular mechanism for autonomous EGFR signaling.},

@article{McGrath1992a,
abstract = {Much of the catalytic power of trypsin is derived from the unusual buried, charged side chain of Asp102. A polar cave provides the stabilization for maintaining the buried charge, and it features the conserved amino acid Ser214 adjacent to Asp102. Ser214 has been replaced with Ala, Glu, and Lys in rat anionic trypsin, and the consequences of these changes have been determined. Three-dimensional structures of the Glu and Lys variant trypsins reveal that the new 214 side chains are buried. The 2.2-A crystal structure (R = 0.150) of trypsin S214K shows that Lys214 occupies the position held by Ser214 and a buried water molecule in the buried polar cave. Lys214-N zeta is solvent inaccessible and is less than 5 A from the catalytic Asp102. The side chain of Glu214 (2.8 A, R = 0.168) in trypsin S214E shows two conformations. In the major one, the Glu carboxylate in S214E forms a hydrogen bond with Asp102. Analytical isoelectrofocusing results show that trypsin S214K has a significantly different isoelectric point than trypsin, corresponding to an additional positive charge. The kinetic parameter kcat demonstrates that, compared to trypsin, S214K has 1{\%} of the catalytic activity on a tripeptide amide substrate and S214E is 44{\%} as active. Electrostatic potential calculations provide corroboration of the charge on Lys214 and are consistent with the kinetic results, suggesting that the presence of Lys214 has disturbed the electrostatic potential of Asp102.},

abstract = {Milestoning is a computational procedure that reduces the dynamics of complex systems to memoryless jumps between intermediates, or milestones, and only retains some information about the probability of these jumps and the time lags between them. Here we analyze a variant of this procedure, termed optimal milestoning, which relies on a specific choice of milestones to capture exactly some kinetic features of the original dynamical system. In particular, we prove that optimal milestoning permits the exact calculation of the mean first passage times (MFPT) between any two milestones. In so doing, we also analyze another variant of the method, called exact milestoning, which also permits the exact calculation of certain MFPTs, but at the price of retaining more information about the original system's dynamics. Finally, we discuss importance sampling strategies based on optimal and exact milestoning that can be used to bypass the simulation of the original system when estimating the statistical quantities used in these methods.},

@article{Chiu2016,
abstract = {One of the unaddressed challenges in drug discovery is that drug potency determined in vitro is not a reliable indicator of drug activity in vivo. Accumulated evidence suggests that in vivo activity is more strongly correlated with the binding/unbinding kinetics than the equilibrium thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions (PLI). However, existing experimental and computational techniques are insufficient in studying the molecular details of kinetics process of PLI. Consequently, we not only have limited mechanistic understanding of the kinetic process but also lack a practical platform for the high-throughput screening and optimization of drug leads based on their kinetic properties. For the first time, we address this unmet need by integrating coarse-grained normal mode analysis with multi-target machine learning (MTML). To test our method, HIV-1 protease is used as a model system. We find that computational models based on the residue normal mode directionality displacement of PLI can not only recapitulate the results from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, but also predict protein-ligand binding/unbinding kinetics accurately. When combined with energetic features, the accuracy of combined kon and koff prediction reaches 74.35{\%}, and the accuracy for compound screening with in vivo drug activity has an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9435. Furthermore, our integrated model provides us with new insights into the molecular determinants of kinetics of PLI. We propose that the coherent coupling of conformational dynamics and thermodynamic interactions between receptor and ligand may play a critical role in determining the kinetic rate constants of PLI. In conclusion, we demonstrate that residue normal mode directionality displacement can serve as a kinetic fingerprint to capture long-time scale conformational dynamics of the binding/unbinding kinetics. Coupled with the MTML, it is possible to screen and optimize compounds based on their binding/unbinding kinetics in a high-throughput fashion. The further development of such computational tools will bridge one of the critical missing links between in vitro compound screening and in vivo drug activity.},

abstract = {Electrostatic forces are one of the primary determinants of molecular interactions. They help guide the folding of proteins, increase the binding of one protein to another and facilitate protein-DNA and protein-ligand binding. A popular method for computing the electrostatic properties of biological systems is to numerically solve the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, and there are several easy-to-use software packages available that solve the PB equation for soluble proteins. Here we present a freely available program, called APBSmem, for carrying out these calculations in the presence of a membrane. The Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) is used as a back-end for solving the PB equation, and a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) coordinates a set of routines that introduce the influence of the membrane, determine its placement relative to the protein, and set the membrane potential. The software Jmol is embedded in the GUI to visualize the protein inserted in the membrane before the calculation and the electrostatic potential after completing the computation. We expect that the ease with which the GUI allows one to carry out these calculations will make this software a useful resource for experimenters and computational researchers alike. Three examples of membrane protein electrostatic calculations are carried out to illustrate how to use APBSmem and to highlight the different quantities of interest that can be calculated.},

abstract = {We report simulations of full ligand exit pathways for the trypsin-benzamidine system, generated using the sampling technique WExplore. WExplore is able to observe millisecond-scale unbinding events using many nanosecond-scale trajectories that are run without introducing biasing forces. The algorithm generates rare events by dividing the coordinate space into regions, on-the-fly, and balancing computational effort between regions through cloning and merging steps, as in the weighted ensemble method. The averaged exit flux yields a ligand exit rate of 180 $\mu$s, which is within an order of magnitude of the experimental value. We obtain broad sampling of ligand exit pathways, and visualize our findings using conformation space networks. The analysis shows three distinct exit channels, two of which are formed through large, rare motions of the loop regions in trypsin. This broad set of ligand-bound poses is then used to investigate general properties of ligand binding: we observe both a direct stabilizing effect of ligand-protein interactions and an indirect destabilizing effect on intraprotein interactions that is induced by the ligand. Significantly, the crystallographic binding poses are distinguished not only because their ligands induce large stabilizing effects, but also because they induce relatively low indirect destabilizations.},

abstract = {We present a strategy for carrying out high-precision calculations of binding free energy and binding enthalpy values from molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. The approach is used to calculate the thermodynamic profiles for binding of nine small molecule guests to either the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) or $\beta$-cyclodextrin ($\beta$CD) host. For these systems, calculations using commodity hardware can yield binding free energy and binding enthalpy values with a precision of ∼0.5 kcal/mol (95{\%} CI) in a matter of days. Crucially, the self- consistency of the approach is established by calculating the binding enthalpy directly, via end point potential energy calculations, and indirectly, via the temperature dependence of the binding free energy, i.e., by the van'tHoff equation. Excellent agreement between the direct and van'tHoff methods is demonstrated for both host−guest systems and an ion-pair model system for which particularly well- converged results are attainable. Additionally, we find that hydrogen mass repartitioning allows marked acceleration of the calculations with no discernible cost in precision or accuracy. Finally, we provide guidance for accurately assessing numerical uncertainty of the results in settings where complex correlations in the time series can pose challenges to statistical analysis. The routine nature and high precision of these binding calculations opens the possibility of including measured binding thermodynamics as target data in force field optimization so that simulations may be used to reliably interpret experimental data and guide molecular design.},

abstract = {We use Markovian milestoning molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a tessellation of the collective variable space for CO localization in myoglobin to estimate the kinetics of entry, exit, and internal site-hopping. The tessellation is determined by analysis of the free-energy surface in that space using transition-path theory (TPT), which provides criteria for defining optimal milestones, allowing short, independent, cell-constrained MD simulations to provide properly weighted kinetic data. We coarse grain the resulting kinetic model at two levels: first, using crystallographically relevant internal cavities and their predicted interconnections and solvent portals; and second, as a three-state side-path scheme inspired by similar models developed from geminate recombination experiments. We show semiquantitative agreement with experiment on entry and exit rates and in the identification of the so-called "histidine gate" at position 64 through which ≈90{\%} of flux between solvent and the distal pocket passes. We also show with six-dimensional calculations that the minimum free-energy pathway of escape through the histidine gate is a "knock-on" mechanism in which motion of the ligand and the gate are sequential and interdependent. In total, these results suggest that such TPT simulations are indeed a promising approach to overcome the practical time-scale limitations of MD to allow reliable estimation of transition mechanisms and rates among metastable states.},

Experimental approaches to binding and unbinding kinetics are nowadays available, but we still lack reliable computational tools for predicting kinetics and residence time. Most attempts have been based on brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are CPU-demanding and not yet particularly accurate. We recently reported a new scaled- MD-based protocol, which showed potential for residence time prediction in drug discovery. Here, we further challenged our procedure's predictive ability by applying our methodology to a series of glucokinase activators that could be useful for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. We combined scaled MD with experimental kinetics measurements and X-ray crystallography, promptly checking the protocol's reliability by directly comparing computational predictions and experimental measures. The good agreement highlights the potential of our scaled-MD-based approach as an innovative method for computationally estimating and predicting drug residence times.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation generates large quantities of data that must be interpreted using physically meaningful analysis. A common approach is to describe the system dynamics in terms of transitions between coarse partitions of conformational space. In contrast to previous work that partitions the space according to geometric proximity, the authors examine here clustering based on kinetics, merging configurational microstates together so as to identify long-lived, i.e., dynamically metastable, states. As test systems microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the polyalanines Ala(8) and Ala(12) are analyzed. Both systems clearly exhibit metastability, with some kinetically distinct metastable states being geometrically very similar. Using the backbone torsion rotamer pattern to define the microstates, a definition is obtained of metastable states whose lifetimes considerably exceed the memory associated with interstate dynamics, thus allowing the kinetics to be described by a Markov model. This model is shown to be valid by comparison of its predictions with the kinetics obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, clustering based on the hydrogen-bonding pattern fails to identify long-lived metastable states or a reliable Markov model. Finally, an approach is proposed to generate a hierarchical model of networks, each having a different number of metastable states. The model hierarchy yields a qualitative understanding of the multiple time and length scales in the dynamics of biomolecules.},

abstract = {Cryptic allosteric sites--transient pockets in a folded protein that are invisible to conventional experiments but can alter enzymatic activity via allosteric communication with the active site--are a promising opportunity for facilitating drug design by greatly expanding the repertoire of available drug targets. Unfortunately, identifying these sites is difficult, typically requiring resource-intensive screening of large libraries of small molecules. Here, we demonstrate that Markov state models built from extensive computer simulations (totaling hundreds of microseconds of dynamics) can identify prospective cryptic sites from the equilibrium fluctuations of three medically relevant proteins--$\beta$-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H--even in the absence of any ligand. As in previous studies, our methods reveal a surprising variety of conformations--including bound-like configurations--that implies a role for conformational selection in ligand binding. Moreover, our analyses lead to a number of unique insights. First, direct comparison of simulations with and without the ligand reveals that there is still an important role for an induced fit during ligand binding to cryptic sites and suggests new conformations for docking. Second, correlations between amino acid sidechains can convey allosteric signals even in the absence of substantial backbone motions. Most importantly, our extensive sampling reveals a multitude of potential cryptic sites--consisting of transient pockets coupled to the active site--even in a single protein. Based on these observations, we propose that cryptic allosteric sites may be even more ubiquitous than previously thought and that our methods should be a valuable means of guiding the search for such sites.},

We identify the presence of a metastable, partially ordered state with a 60-fold slowdown in conformational kinetics that arises due to phosphorylation, kinetically stabilizing residues known to participate in an early binding intermediate. We show that this effect is only partially reconstituted by mutation to glutamate, indicating that the phosphate is uniquely required for the long-lived state to arise.

abstract = {Milestoning is a method for calculating kinetics and thermodynamics of long time processes typically not accessible for straightforward Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. In the Milestoning approach, the system of interest is partitioned into cells by dividing hypersurfaces (Milestones) and transitions are computed between nearby hypersurfaces. Kinetics and thermodynamics are derived from the statistics of these transitions. The original Milestoning work concentrated on systems in which a one-dimensional reaction coordinate or an order parameter could be identified. In many biomolecular processes the reaction proceeds via multiple channels or following more than a single order parameter. A description based on a one-dimensional reaction coordinate may be insufficient. In the present paper we introduce a variation that overcomes this limitation.Following the ideas of Vanden-Eijnden and Venturoli on Voronoi cells that avoid the use of an order parameter (J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 194101), we describe another way to "Milestone" systems without a reaction coordinate. We examine the assumptions of the Milestoning calculations of mean first passage times (MFPT) and describe strategies to weaken these assumptions. The method described in this paper, Directional Milestoning, arranges hypersurfaces in higher dimensions that "tag" trajectories such that efficient calculations can be done and at the same time the assumptions required for exact calculations of MFPTs are satisfied approximately.In the original Milestoning papers trajectories are initiated from an equilibrium set of conformations. Here a more accurate distribution, that mimics the first hitting point distribution, is used. We demonstrate the usage of Directional Milestoning in conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide (in vacuum and in aqueous solution) and compare the correctness, efficiency, and statistical stability of the method with exact MD and with a related method.},

A single relaxational phenomenon was observed only when the solutes were coexisting, although no relaxation was found in the beta-CD solution or in the acid solutions. The absorption was also measured in a solution of pentanoic acid (dissociated form) with beta-CD, and single relaxation was detected. The ultrasonic relaxation observed in these solutions was due to a perturbation of a chemical equilibrium related to a reaction of an inclusion complex formed by the host and guest. The equilibrium constant was obtained from the dependence of the maximum absorption per wavelength on the guest concentration. The rate constant for the inclusion process of the guest into a cavity of beta-CD and that for the leaving process from the cavity were determined from the obtained relaxation frequency and the equilibrium constant. The standard volume change of the reaction was also computed from the maximum absorption per wavelength. These results were compared with those in solutions containing both beta-CD and different guest molecules. It was found that the hydrophobicity of guest molecules played an important role in the formation of the inclusion complex and also that the charge on the carboxylic group had a considerable effect on the kinetic characteristics of the complexation reaction.},

Reaching a complete mechanistic understanding of large-scale conformational transformations underlying the activation of kinases could greatly help in the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. In principle, the nature of conformational transition could be modelled in silico via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, although this is very challenging because of the long activation timescales. Here we employ a computational paradigm that couples transition pathway techniques and Markov state model-based massively distributed simulations for mapping the conformational landscape of c-src tyrosine kinase. The computations provide the thermodynamics and kinetics of kinase activation for the first time, and help identify key structural intermediates. Furthermore, the presence of a novel allosteric site in an intermediate state of c-src that could be potentially used for drug design is predicted.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic absorption method was applied to elucidate the dynamic properties of host-guest complexation between $\alpha$-cyclodextrin or $\beta$-cyclodextrin (host) and butanol isomers (guest) at 25°C. The aim of this work was to reveal the effect of a structural difference in the hydrophobic part of a guest on the kinetic parameters for an inclusion reaction with cyclodextrins. Moreover, it was expected to clarify the effect of the cavity size on the reaction. Only when the host and guest existed together in water, a clear single relaxational phenomenon was observed. The cause of the relaxation was responsible for the complexation reaction between the host and the guest. The rate and equilibrium constants were obtained from the concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency, and the standard volume changes of the complexation reaction were from the maximum absorption per wavelength. The backward rate constant, kb- was very dependent on the structure of the guest molecule. The kb value decreased in the next hydrophobic series, nor- {\textless} sec- {\textless} tert- in $\beta$-CD systems, although a smaller kb value was observed when the guest possessed a normal carbon chain in $\alpha$-CD systems. The results of the volume change of the reaction implied that $\alpha$-CD could only include a guest quite shallowly, and almost the entire guest molecule was included into the $\beta$-CD cavity.},

abstract = {Nearly every enzyme undergoes a significant change in structure after binding it's substrate. Experimental and theoretical analyses of the role of changes in HIV reverse transcriptase structure in selecting a correct substrate are presented. Atomically detailed simulations using the Milestoning method predict a rate and free energy profile of the conformational change commensurate with experimental data. A large conformational change occurring on a millisecond timescale locks the correct nucleotide at the active site but promotes release of a mismatched nucleotide. The positions along the reaction coordinate that decide the yield of the reaction are not determined by the chemical step. Rather, the initial steps of weak substrate binding and protein conformational transition significantly enrich the yield of a reaction with a correct substrate, whereas the same steps diminish the reaction probability of an incorrect substrate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Anton 2 is a second-generation special-purpose supercomputer for molecular dynamics simulations that achieves significant gains in performance, programmability, and capacity compared to its predecessor, Anton 1. The architecture of Anton 2 is tailored for fine-grained event-driven operation, which improves performance by increasing the overlap of computation with communication, and also allows a wider range of algorithms to run efficiently, enabling many new software-based optimizations. A 512-node Anton 2 machine, currently in operation, is up to ten times faster than Anton 1 with the same number of nodes, greatly expanding the reach of all-atom bio molecular simulations. Anton 2 is the first platform to achieve simulation rates of multiple microseconds of physical time per day for systems with millions of atoms. Demonstrating strong scaling, the machine simulates a standard 23,558-atom benchmark system at a rate of 85 $\mu$s/day -- 180 times faster than any commodity hardware platform or general-purpose supercomputer.},

The fundamental objects implemented in the Milestoning algorithm are the first passage time distributions between adjacent protein configuration milestones. The method proposed herein aims to further enhance Milestoning by employing an artificial applied force, akin to wind, which pushes the trajectories from their initial states to their final states, and subsequently re-weights the trajectories to yield the true first passage time distributions in a fraction of the computation time required for unassisted calculations. The re-weighting method, rooted in Ito's stochastic calculus, was adapted from previous work by Andricioaei et al. The theoretical basis for this technique and numerical examples are presented.},

abstract = {The fine structure of ion-channel activations by junctional nicotinic receptors in adult frog muscle fibres has been investigated. The agonists used were acetylcholine (ACh), carbachol (CCh), suberyldicholine (SubCh) and decan-1,10-dicarboxylic acid dicholine ester (DecCh). Individual activations (bursts) were interrupted by short closed periods; the distribution of their durations showed a major fast component ('short gaps') and a minor slower component ('intermediate gaps'). The mean duration of both short and intermediate gaps was dependent on the nature of the agonist. For short gaps the mean durations (microseconds) were: ACh, 20; SubCh, 43; DecCh, 71; CCh, 13. The mean number of short gaps per burst were: ACh, 1.9; SubCh, 4.1; DecCh, 2.0. The mean number of short gaps per burst, and the mean number per unit open time, were dependent on the nature of the agonist, but showed little dependence on agonist concentration or membrane potential for ACh, SubCh and DecCh. The short gaps in CCh increased in frequency with agonist concentration and were mainly produced by channel blockages by CCh itself. Partially open channels (subconductance states) were clearly resolved rarely (0.4{\%} of gaps within bursts) but regularly. Conductances of 18{\%} (most commonly) and 71{\%} of the main value were found. However, most short gaps were probably full closures. The distribution of burst lengths had two components. The faster component represented mainly isolated short openings that were much more common at low agonist concentrations. The slower component represented bursts of longer openings. Except at very low concentrations more than 85{\%} of activations were of this type, which corresponds to the 'channel lifetime' found by noise analysis. The frequency of channel openings increased slightly with hyperpolarization. The short gaps during activations were little affected when (a) the [H+]o or [Ca2+]o were reduced to 1/10th of normal, (b) when extracellular Ca2+ was replaced by Mg2+, (c) when the [Cl-]i was raised or (d) when, in one experiment on an isolated inside-out patch, the normal intracellular constituents were replaced by KCl. Reduction of [Ca2+]O to 1/10 of normal increased the single-channel conductance by 50{\%}, and considerably increased the number of intermediate gaps. No temporal asymmetry was detectable in the bursts of openings. Positive correlations were found between the lengths of successive apparent open times at low SubCh concentrations, but no correlations between burst lengths were detectable. The component of brief openings behaves, at low concentrations, as though it originates from openings of singly occupied channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In this study, we analyse ten different protease-inhibitor complexes carrying major resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) G48V, I50V, and L90M using molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that alchemical free energy calculations can consistently predict the effect of mutations on drug binding. By explicitly probing different protonation states of the catalytic aspartic dyad, we reveal the importance of the correct choice of protonation state for the accuracy of the result. We also provide insight into how different mutations affect drug binding in their specific ways, with the unifying theme of how all of them affect the crucial for drug binding regions of the protease.},

The connectivity between the glycourils and naphthalene rings largely defines the opening size of the cucurbituril cavity and its diameter. The large hydrophobic binding cavity is flexible and is able to adapt to guests of various size and topology. The recognition event between the aCBs and guests results in modification of the fluorescence of the terminal walls, a fluorescence response that can be used to sense the drugs of abuse morphine, heroin, and oxycodone as well as their metabolites. Molecular dynamics is employed to understand the nature of the binding interactions. A simple three sensor cross-reactive array enables the determination of drugs and their metabolites in water with high fidelity and low error. Quantitative experiments performed in urine using a new three-way calibration model allows for determination of drugs and their metabolites using one sensor from a single fluorescence reading.},

Kinetic analysis provided direct evidence that MBP recognizes a ligand through an 'induced-fit' mechanism, not through the generally proposed selection mechanism for proteins with conformational dynamics such as MBP. Our results indicated that the mere presence of intrinsic dynamics is insufficient for a 'selection' mechanism. An energetic analysis of ligand binding implicated the critical role of conformational dynamics in facilitating a structural change that occurs upon ligand binding.},

Different charging conditions of the peptide (positive, negative, or zwitterion) are considered. Both experiment and simulation reproduce the qualitative trend and suggest that the fastest permeation is when the tryptophan is positively charged. The permeation mechanism, which is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations, is of a translocation assisted by a local defect.

abstract = {To date, the slowest-folding proteins folded ab initio by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have had folding times in the range of nanoseconds to microseconds. We report simulations of several folding trajectories of NTL9(1−39), a protein which has a folding time of 1.5 ms. Distributed molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on GPU processors were used to generate ensembles of trajectories out to 40 $\mu$s for several temperatures and starting states. At a temperature less than the melting point of the force field, we observe a small number of productive folding events, consistent with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled two-state simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding rate predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding rate (640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of two-state folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse mesoscopic substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000 macrostates transited by the top 10 folding pathways reveals that native-like pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for macrostates with pfold {\textgreater} 0.5, suggesting $\beta$12 hairpin formation may be rate-limiting. We believe that using simulation data such as these to seed adaptive resampling simulations will be a promising new method for achieving statistically converged descriptions of folding landscapes at longer time scales than ever before.},

abstract = {Drug discovery is expensive and high-risk. Its main reasons of failure are lack of efficacy and toxicity of a drug candidate. Binding affinity for the biological target has been usually considered one of the most relevant figures of merit to judge a drug candidate along with bioavailability, selectivity and metabolic properties, which could depend on off-target interactions. Nevertheless, affinity does not always satisfactorily correlate with in vivo drug efficacy. It is indeed becoming increasingly evident that the time a drug spends in contact with its target (aka residence time) can be a more reliable figure of merit. Experimental kinetic measurements are operatively limited by the cost and the time needed to synthesize compounds to be tested, to express and purify the target, and to setup the assays. We present here a simple and efficient molecular-dynamics-based computational approach to prioritize compounds according to their residence time. We devised a multiple-replica scaled molecular dynamics protocol with suitably defined harmonic restraints to accelerate the unbinding events while preserving the native fold. Ligands are ranked according to the mean observed scaled unbinding time. The approach, trivially parallel and easily implementable, was validated against experimental information available on biological systems of pharmacological relevance.},

abstract = {The kinetic rate constants of binding were estimated for four biochemically relevant molecular systems by a method that uses milestoning theory to combine Brownian dynamics simulations with more detailed molecular dynamics simulations. The rate constants found using this method agreed well with experimentally and theoretically obtained values. We predicted the association rate of a small charged molecule toward both a charged and an uncharged spherical receptor and verified the estimated value with Smoluchowski theory. We also calculated the kon rate constant for superoxide dismutase with its natural substrate, O2-, in a validation of a previous experiment using similar methods but with a number of important improvements. We also calculated the kon for a new system: the N-terminal domain of Troponin C with its natural substrate Ca2+. The kon calculated for the latter two systems closely resemble experimentally obtained values. This novel multiscale approach is computationally cheaper and more parallelizable when compared to other methods of similar accuracy. We anticipate that this methodology will be useful for predicting kinetic rate constants and for understanding the process of binding between a small molecule and a protein receptor.},

abstract = {Markov state models of molecular kinetics (MSMs), in which the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule is approximated by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

We prove that the quaternion method is equivalent to the well-known formula due to Kabsch. We analyze the various cases that may arise, and give a complete enumeration of the special cases in terms of the arrangement of the eigenvalues of a traceless, 4 x 4 symmetric matrix. A key result here is an expression for the gradient of the RMSD as a function of model parameters. This can be useful, for example, in finding the minimum energy path of a reaction using the elastic band methods or in optimizing model parameters to best fit a target structure.},

abstract = {A key factor influencing a drug's efficacy is its residence time in the binding pocket of the host protein. Using atomistic computer simulation to predict this residence time and the associated dissociation process is a desirable but extremely difficult task due to the long timescales involved. This gets further complicated by the presence of biophysical factors such as steric and solvation effects. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the unbinding of a popular prototypical hydrophobic cavity-ligand system using a metadynamics-based approach that allows direct assessment of kinetic pathways and parameters. When constrained to move in an axial manner, the unbinding time is found to be on the order of 4,000 s. In accordance with previous studies, we find that the cavity must pass through a region of sharp wetting transition manifested by sudden and high fluctuations in solvent density. When we remove the steric constraints on ligand, the unbinding happens predominantly by an alternate pathway, where the unbinding becomes 20 times faster, and the sharp wetting transition instead becomes continuous. We validate the unbinding timescales from metadynamics through a Poisson analysis, and by comparison through detailed balance to binding timescale estimates from unbiased MD. This work demonstrates that enhanced sampling can be used to perform explicit solvent MD studies at timescales previously unattainable, to our knowledge, obtaining direct and reliable pictures of the underlying physiochemical factors including free energies and rate constants.},

abstract = {Ring-shaped, hexameric ATPase motors fulfill key functions in cellular processes, such as genome replication, transcription, or protein degradation, by translocating a long substrate through their central pore powered by ATP hydrolysis. Despite intense research efforts, the atomic-level mechanism transmitting chemical energy from hydrolysis into mechanical force that translocates the substrate is still unclear. Here we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with advanced path sampling techniques and milestoning analysis to characterize how mRNA substrate is translocated by an exemplary homohexameric motor, the transcription termination factor Rho. We find that the release of hydrolysis product (ADP + Pi) triggers the force-generating process of Rho through a 0.1 millisecond-long conformational transition, the time scale seen also in experiment. The calculated free energy profiles and kinetics show that Rho unidirectionally translocates the single-stranded RNA substrate via a population shift of the conformational states of Rho; upon hydrolysis product release, the most favorable conformation shifts from the pretranslocation state to the post-translocation state. Via two previously unidentified intermediate states, the RNA chain is seen to be pulled by six K326 side chains, whose motions are induced by highly coordinated relative translation and rotation of Rho's six subunits. The present study not only reveals in new detail the mechanism employed by ring-shaped ATPase motors, for example the use of loosely bound and tightly bound hydrolysis reactant and product states to coordinate motor action, but also provides an effective approach to identify allosteric sites of multimeric enzymes in general.},

Association and dissociation rate constants and affinities were determined and displayed as k(on)-k(off)-K(D) maps. It was shown that different classes of inhibitors fall into distinct clusters in these maps. Significant changes in association and dissociation rates were found as a result of modifying the P1/P1' or P2/P2' side chains of a linear lead compound. Similarly, cyclic urea and cyclic sulfamide inhibitors displayed different kinetic features and the affinities of both classes of cyclic compounds were limited by fast dissociation rates. These results confirm that association and dissociation rates are important features of drug-target interactions and indicate that optimization of inhibitor efficacy may be guided by aiming for high association and low dissociation rates rather than high affinity alone. The present approach thus provides a new tool for structure-interaction kinetic analysis and drug discovery.},

abstract = {Understanding the fine balance between changes of entropy and enthalpy and the competition between a guest and water molecules in molecular binding is crucial in fundamental studies and practical applications. Experiments provide measurements. However, illustrating the binding/unbinding processes gives a complete picture of molecular recognition not directly available from experiments, and computational methods bridge the gaps. Here, we investigated guest association/dissociation with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) by using microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, post-analysis and numerical calculations. We computed association and dissociation rate constants, enthalpy, and solvent and solute entropy of binding. All the computed values of kon, koff, $\Delta$H, $\Delta$S, and $\Delta$G could be compared with experimental data directly and agreed reasonably with experiment findings. Water molecules play a crucial role in guest binding to beta-CD. Collective water/beta-CD motions could contribute to different computed kon and $\Delta$H values by using GAFF-CD and q4MD-CD force fields for beta-CD, mainly because of the motion of beta-CD that provides different hydrogen-bond networks of water molecules in the cavity of free beta-CD and the strength of desolvation penalty. Both force fields resulted in similar computed $\Delta$G from independently computed kinetics rates and thermodynamics properties ($\Delta$H, $\Delta$S) and suggest the same driving forces of binding, non-polar attractions between solutes and entropy gain of desolvating water molecules. However, the balances of $\Delta$H and -T$\Delta$S and enthalpy-entropy compensation are not identical. The study further interprets experiments, deepens our understanding of ligand binding, and suggests strategies for force field parameterization.},

Besides, in addition to the Poisson process, one may use fewer samples for predicting residence time due to the reason that, in a large extent, the calculated drug residence time is stable and independent of the number of samples used for the prediction.

abstract = {We use Bayesian inference to derive the rate coefficients of a coarse master equation from molecular dynamics simulations. Results from multiple short simulation trajectories are used to estimate propagators. A likelihood function constructed as a product of the propagators provides a posterior distribution of the free coefficients in the rate matrix determining the Markovian master equation. Extensions to non-Markovian dynamics are discussed, using the trajectory paths as observations. The Markovian approach is illustrated for the filling and emptying transitions of short carbon nanotubes dissolved in water. We show that accurate thermodynamic and kinetic properties, such as free energy surfaces and kinetic rate coefficients, can be computed from coarse master equations obtained through Bayesian inference.

In recent years, atomistic free energy calculations have proven to be a valid tool to complement experiments in characterizing the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of protein/ligand interaction. Here, we investigate, through a recently developed metadynamics-based protocol, the unbinding mechanism of an inhibitor of the pharmacologically relevant target p38 MAP kinase. We provide a thorough description of the ligand unbinding pathway identifying the most stable binding mode and other thermodynamically relevant poses. From our simulations, we estimated the unbinding rate as koff = 0.020 ± 0.011 s–1. This is in good agreement with the experimental value (koff = 0.14 s–1). Next, we developed a Markov state model that allowed identifying the rate-limiting step of the ligand unbinding process. Our calculations further show that the solvation of the ligand and that of...},

abstract = {Drug-binding kinetics could play important roles in determining the efficacy of drugs and has caught the attention of more drug designers. Using the dissociation of 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]-pyridines from the focal adhesion kinase as an example, this work finds that steered molecular dynamics simulations could help screen compounds with long-residence times. It also reveals a two-step mechanism of ligand dissociation resembling the release of ADP from protein kinase A reported earlier. A phenyl group attaching to the pyrrole prolongs residence time by creating a large activation barrier for transition from the bound to the intermediate state when it becomes exposed to the solvent. Principal component analysis shows that ligand dissociation does not couple with large-scale collective motions of the protein involving many of its amino acids. Rather, a small subset of amino acids dominates. Some of these amino acids do not contact the ligands directly along the dissociation pathways and could exert long-range allosteric effects. {\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Steered molecular dynamics simulations show that 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]-pyridines dissociate from the focal adhesion kinase through a two-step mechanism, revealed by the time course of different properties such as the solvent-accessible surface area of the compounds. A similar two-step mechanism was found before for the dissociation of ADP from protein kinase A. Many ATP-competitive inhibitors might dissociate from protein kinases through this same mechanism.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic absorption coefficients in the frequency range 0.8-95 MHz were measured in aqueous solution of undissociated and dissociated propionic acid in the presence of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) at 25 degreesC. A single relaxational absorption was found, although it was not observed in the absence of beta-CD. The cause of the relaxation was attributed to a perturbation of a chemical equilibrium associated with an interaction between propionic acid and beta-CD. The rate and thermodynamic constants for the association and dissociation reaction for the complex were determined from the concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency and the maximum absorption per wavelength. It was found that the complex formed by beta-CD and propionic acid is more stable when the acid is in undissociated form. Further, the ultrasonic relaxation associated with a proton-transfer reaction was also observed when no additive exists in the solution. The rate and thermodynamic parameters were also determined precisely. [References: 16]},

A homogeneous force field, namely “q4md-CD”, has been built from the development of a new force field topology database and from a combination of the GLYCAM04 and Amber99SB force fields to correctly describe the geometrical, structural, dynamical and hydrogen bonding aspects of heterogeneous cyclodextrin based systems. These include native, organo- and peptidic-linked cyclodextrins. q4md-CD features: (i) geometrical parameters from Amber99SB to describe the protein parts, (ii) geometrical parameters from GLYCAM04 for the carbohydrate and organic parts when available or those of Amber99SB otherwise, (iii) partial atomic charges, embedded in force field libraries for the carbohydrate and organic fragments, were derived using the R.E.D. tools according to the “Amber” strategy and (iv) scaling factors of 1.2 and 2.0 were imposed for the 1–4 electrostatic and 1–4 van der Waals interactions, respectively. Results given by q4md-CD on native cyclodextrins have been compared to those obtained with reference to force fields like GLYCAM04, GLYCAM06 and Amber99SB as well as with experimental data. This work not only gives a global view of the performances of the aforementioned force fields towards a correct description of solvated cyclodextrins, but also extends the capabilities of current force fields by addressing some issues concerning hydrogen bonding and opens new possibilities towards studies of glycoconjugates by molecular dynamics.},

abstract = {HIV maturation requires multiple cleavage of long polyprotein chains into functional proteins that include the viral protease itself. Initial cleavage by the protease dimer occurs from within these precursors, and yet only a single protease monomer is embedded in each polyprotein chain. Self-activation has been proposed to start from a partially dimerized protease formed from monomers of different chains binding its own N termini by self-association to the active site, but a complete structural understanding of this critical step in HIV maturation is missing. Here, we captured the critical self-association of immature HIV-1 protease to its extended amino-terminal recognition motif using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, thus confirming the postulated intramolecular mechanism in atomic detail. We show that self-association to a catalytically viable state requires structural cooperativity of the flexible $\beta$-hairpin "flap" regions of the enzyme and that the major transition pathway is first via self-association in the semiopen/open enzyme states, followed by enzyme conformational transition into a catalytically viable closed state. Furthermore, partial N-terminal threading can play a role in self-association, whereas wide opening of the flaps in concert with self-association is not observed. We estimate the association rate constant (k(on)) to be on the order of ∼1 × 10(4) s(-1), suggesting that N-terminal self-association is not the rate-limiting step in the process. The shown mechanism also provides an interesting example of molecular conformational transitions along the association pathway.},

abstract = {The interaction between HIV-1 protease and 58 structurally diverse transition-state analogue inhibitors has been analyzed by a surface plasmon resonance based biosensor. Association and dissociation rate constants and affinities were determined and displayed as k(on)-k(off)-K(D) maps. It was shown that different classes of inhibitors fall into distinct clusters in these maps. Significant changes in association and dissociation rates were found as a result of modifying the P1/P1' or P2/P2' side chains of a linear lead compound. Similarly, cyclic urea and cyclic sulfamide inhibitors displayed different kinetic features and the affinities of both classes of cyclic compounds were limited by fast dissociation rates. These results confirm that association and dissociation rates are important features of drug-target interactions and indicate that optimization of inhibitor efficacy may be guided by aiming for high association and low dissociation rates rather than high affinity alone. The present approach thus provides a new tool for structure-interaction kinetic analysis and drug discovery.},

abstract = {SignificanceA crucial factor for drug efficacy is not just the binding affinity, but also the mean residence time in the binding pocket, usually quantified by its inverse, koff. This is an important parameter that regulates the time during which the drug is active. Whereas the calculation of the binding affinity is by now routine, the calculation of koff has proven more challenging because the timescales involved far exceed the limits of standard molecular dynamics simulation. We propose a metadynamics-based strategy that allows reaching timescales of seconds, and estimate koff along with unbinding pathways and associated dynamical bottlenecks. The protocol is exemplified for trypsin-benzamidine unbinding. This work is a step towards a more effective computer-based drug design. The ability to predict the mechanisms and the associated rate constants of protein-ligand unbinding is of great practical importance in drug design. In this work we demonstrate how a recently introduced metadynamics-based approach allows exploration of the unbinding pathways, estimation of the rates, and determination of the rate-limiting steps in the paradigmatic case of the trypsin-benzamidine system. Protein, ligand, and solvent are described with full atomic resolution. Using metadynamics, multiple unbinding trajectories that start with the ligand in the crystallographic binding pose and end with the ligand in the fully solvated state are generated. The unbinding rate [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} is computed from the mean residence time of the ligand. Using our previously computed binding affinity we also obtain the binding rate [IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}. Both rates are in agreement with reported experimental values. We uncover the complex pathways of unbinding trajectories and describe the critical rate-limiting steps with unprecedented detail. Our findings illuminate the role played by the coupling between subtle protein backbone fluctuations and the solvation by water molecules that enter the binding pocket and assist in the breaking of the shielded hydrogen bonds. We expect our approach to be useful in calculating rates for general protein-ligand systems and a valid support for drug design.},

abstract = {Abstract Biophysical studies with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are typically very challenging due to the poor stability of these receptors when solubilized from the cell membrane into detergent solutions. However, the stability of a GPCR can be greatly improved by introducing a number of point mutations into the protein sequence to give a stabilized receptor or StaR{\textregistered}. Here, we present the utility of StaRs for biophysical studies and the screening of fragment libraries. Two case studies are used to illustrate the methods: first, the screening of a library of fragments by surface plasmon resonance against the adenosine A2Areceptor StaR, demonstrating how very small and weakly active xanthine fragments can be detected binding to the protein on chips; second, the screening and detection of fragment hits of a larger fragment library in an NMR format called TINS (target-immobilized NMR screening) against the $\beta$1adrenergic StaR. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The complexation behavior of 1-naphthyl-1-ethanol (1-NpOH) and 2-naphthyl-1-ethanol (2-NpOH) with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was studied by employing several spectroscopic techniques. In the case of 1-NpOH, only a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry is formed with beta-CD, which. has an equilibrium constant that is smaller than that observed for the 1:1 complex between beta-CD and 2-NpOH. Excimer emission was observed in the presence of beta-CD for solutions containing high 2-NpOH concentrations. This excimer emission was ascribed to a complex with 2:2 beta-CD/2-NpOH stoichiometry. In addition, H-1 NMR data suggest that 2-NpOH is axially incorporated into the beta-CD cavity. Only in the case of 2-NpOH was a broadening of the signals corresponding to the aromatic protons observed in the presence of beta-CD. This broadening was attributed to the formation of the 2:2 complex. The dynamics of NpOH complexation was investigated by using the quenching methodology for triplet states. The entry rate constants for the 1:1 complex of 1-NpOH and 2-NpOH are (4.7 +/- 1.9) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) and (2.9 +/- 1.6) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively, whereas the exit rate constants for the two compounds are (4.8 +/- 1.8) x 10(5) s(-1) and (1.8 +/- 0.7) x 10(5) s(-1). In the case of 2-NpOH, we were able for the first time to estimate the rate constant for the dissociation of a beta-CD 2:2 complex ((0.2-2.5) x 10(3) s(-1)), showing that the dynamics for complexes including more than one cyclodextrin are remarkably slower than the dynamics observed for 1:1 complexes.},

abstract = {Classical Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for liquid water in the NPT ensemble at 25 °C and 1 atm using six of the simpler intermolecular potential functions for the water dimer: Bernal–Fowler (BF), SPC, ST2, TIPS2, TIP3P, and TIP4P. Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18{\%} overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool for modeling both the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular systems. In addition, they provide a rigorous means to combine information from multiple sources into a single model and to direct future simulations/experiments to minimize uncertainties in the model. However, constructing MSMs is challenging because doing so requires decomposing the extremely high dimensional and rugged free energy landscape of a molecular system into long-lived states, also called metastable states. Thus, their application has generally required significant chemical intuition and hand-tuning. To address this limitation we have developed a toolkit for automating the construction of MSMs called MSMBUILDER (available at https://simtk.org/home/msmbuilder). In this work we demonstrate the application of MSMBUILDER to the villin headpiece (HP-35 NleNle), one of the smallest and fastest folding proteins. We show that the resulting MSM captures both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the original molecular dynamics of the system. As a first step toward experimental validation of our methodology we show that our model provides accurate structure prediction and that the longest timescale events correspond to folding.},

The space of the membrane system is divided into cells and the different cells are characterized by order parameters presenting the number densities. The dynamics of the order parameters are probed with Milestoning. The methodology is illustrated here for a phospholipid membrane system (a hydrated bilayer of DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) lipid molecules). Significant inhomogeneity in membrane internal number density leads to complex free energy landscape and local maps of transition times. Dynamics and distributions of cavities within the membrane assist the permeation of nonpolar solutes such as xenon atoms. It is illustrated that quantitative and detailed dynamics of water transport through DOPC membrane can be analyzed using Milestoning with fields.

abstract = {Cyclodextrins are a family of cyclic oligosaccharides composed of $\alpha$-(1,4) linked glucopyranose subunits. Cyclodextrins are useful molecular chelating agents. They possess a cage-like supramolecular structure, which is the same as the structures formed from cryptands, calixarenes, cyclophanes, spherands and crown ethers. These compounds having supramolecular structures carry out chemical reactions that involve intramolecular interactions where covalent bonds are not formed between interacting molecules, ions or radicals. The majority of all these reactions are of 'host-guest' type. Compared to all the supramolecular hosts mentioned above, cyclodextrins are most important. Because of their inclusion complex forming capability, the properties of the materials with which they complex can be modified significantly. As a result of molecular complexation phenomena CDs are widely used in many industrial products, technologies and analytical methods. The negligible cytotoxic effects of CDs are an important attribute in applications such as rug carrier, food and flavours, cosmetics, packing, textiles, separation processes, environment protection, fermentation and catalysis. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a promising computational tool that allows us to simulate protein–drug binding at an atomistic level. However, the gap between the time scales of current simulations and those of many drug binding processes has limited the usage of conventional MD, which has been reflected in studies of the HIV protease. Here, we have applied a robust enhanced simulation method, Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD), to sample binding pathways of the XK263 ligand and associated protein conformational changes in the HIV protease. During two of 10 independent GaMD simulations performed over 500–2500 ns, the ligand was observed to successfully bind to the protein active site. Although GaMD-derived free energy profiles were not fully converged because of insufficient sampling of the complex system, the simulations still allowed us to identify relat...},

The key tenet of this model is that the lifetime (or residence time) of the binary drug-target complex, and not the binding affinity per se, dictates much of the in vivo pharmacological activity.

abstract = {A single ultrasonic relaxational phenomenon was observed in aqueous solutions containing both beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) as host and nonionized or ionized acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) as guest. The observed relaxation was responsible for a dynamic complexation reaction between beta-CD and aspirin molecules, concomitant with a volume change during the reaction. The kinetic and equilibrium constants for the complexation in the acid (nonionized) form of the aspirin system were derived from the guest concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency. The equilibrium constant for the carboxylate (ionized) form of aspirin was determined from the concentration dependence of a maximum absorption per wavelength, and the rate constants were calculated by using the determined equilibrium constant and the observed relaxation frequencies, which remained nearly almost constant over the concentration range studied. The results showed that the effect of charge on the aspirin molecule was reflected only in the dissociation process from the beta-CD cavity, while no remarkable change was seen in the association process whose rate was diffusion controlled. The results could be explained on the basis of the difference of the hydrophobic moieties in the two guests that were included in the host cavity. The results of the standard volume change for the complexation reaction were closely related to the number of expelled water molecules originally located in the beta-CD cavity and the volume of the aspirin molecule incorporated into the beta-CD cavity.},

Seven metastable conformations with different binding pocket structures are found that interconvert at timescales of tens of microseconds. These conformations differ in their substrate-binding affinities and binding/dissociation rates. For each metastable state, corresponding solved structures of Trypsin mutants or similar serine proteases are contained in the protein data bank. Thus, our wild-type simulations explore a space of conformations that can be individually stabilized by adding ligands or making suitable changes in protein sequence.

abstract = {Characterizing the equilibrium ensemble of folding pathways, including their relative probability, is one of the major challenges in protein folding theory today. Although this information is in principle accessible via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute in practice because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an appreciable number of folding events, unless very simplified protein models are used. Here we present an approach that allows for the reconstruction of the full ensemble of folding pathways from simulations that are much shorter than the folding time. This approach can be applied to all-atom protein simulations in explicit solvent. It does not use a predefined reaction coordinate but is based on partitioning the state space into small conformational states and constructing a Markov model between them. A theory is presented that allows for the extraction of the full ensemble of transition pathways from the unfolded to the folded configurations. The approach is applied to the folding of a PinWW domain in explicit solvent where the folding time is two orders of magnitude larger than the length of individual simulations. The results are in good agreement with kinetic experimental data and give detailed insights about the nature of the folding process which is shown to be surprisingly complex and parallel. The analysis reveals the existence of misfolded trap states outside the network of efficient folding intermediates that significantly reduce the folding speed.},

We show that various probability distributions on the reactive trajectories can be expressed in terms of the equilibrium distribution of the process and the so-called committor functions which give the probability that the process reaches first B before reaching A, either backward or forward in time. Using these objects, we obtain (i) the distribution of reactive trajectories, which gives the proportion of time reactive trajectories spend in sets outside of A and B; (ii) the hitting point distribution of the reactive trajectories on a surface, which measures where the reactive trajectories hit the surface when they cross it; (iii) the last hitting point distribution of the reactive trajectories on the surface; (iv) the probability current of reactive trajectories, the integral of which on a surface gives the net average flux of reactive trajectories across this surface; (v) the average frequency of reactive trajectories, which gives the average number of transitions between A and B per unit of time; and (vi) the traffic distribution of reactive trajectories, which gives some information about the regions the reactive trajectories visit regardless of the time they spend in these regions.},

abstract = {Drug discovery is expensive and high-risk. Its main reasons of failure are lack of efficacy and toxicity of a drug candidate. Binding affinity for the biological target has been usually considered one of the most relevant figures of merit to judge a drug candidate along with bioavailability, selectivity and metabolic properties, which could depend on off-target interactions. Nevertheless, affinity does not always satisfactorily correlate with in vivo drug efficacy. It is indeed becoming increasingly evident that the time a drug spends in contact with its target (aka residence time) can be a more reliable figure of merit. Experimental kinetic measurements are operatively limited by the cost and the time needed to synthesize compounds to be tested, to express and purify the target, and to setup the assays. We present here a simple and efficient molecular-dynamics-based computational approach to prioritize compounds according to their residence time. We devised a multiple-replica scaled molecular dynamics protocol with suitably defined harmonic restraints to accelerate the unbinding events while preserving the native fold. Ligands are ranked according to the mean observed scaled unbinding time. The approach, trivially parallel and easily implementable, was validated against experimental information available on biological systems of pharmacological relevance.},

NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

Foremost among the models used to elucidate the electrostatic potential is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; however, existing methods for solving this equation have limited the scope of accurate electrostatic calculations to relatively small biomolecular systems. Here we present the application of numerical methods to enable the trivially parallel solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for supramolecular structures that are orders of magnitude larger in size. As a demonstration of this methodology, electrostatic potentials have been calculated for large microtubule and ribosome structures. The results point to the likely role of electrostatics in a variety of activities of these structures.},

abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) have been successful in computing metastable states, slow relaxation timescales and associated structural changes, and stationary or kinetic experimental observables of complex molecules from large amounts of molecular dynamics simulation data. However, MSMs approximate the true dynamics by assuming a Markov chain on a clusters discretization of the state space. This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional biomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of MSMs has, therefore, been limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on the discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase-space molecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is observed on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov Models (PMMs). Robust estimation methods for PMMs are not yet available, but we derive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It is shown how various molecular observables of interest that are often computed from MSMs can be computed from HMMs/PMMs. The new framework is applicable to both, simulation and single-molecule experimental data. We demonstrate its versatility by applications to educative model systems, a 1 ms Anton MD simulation of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein, and an optical tweezer force probe trajectory of an RNA hairpin.},

abstract = {Milestoning is a procedure to compute the time evolution of complicated processes such as barrier crossing events or long diffusive transitions between predefined states. Milestoning reduces the dynamics to transition events between intermediates (the milestones) and computes the local kinetic information to describe these transitions via short molecular dynamics (MD) runs between the milestones. The procedure relies on the ability to reinitialize MD trajectories on the milestones to get the right kinetic information about the transitions. It also rests on the assumptions that the transition events between successive milestones and the time lags between these transitions are statistically independent. In this paper, we analyze the validity of these assumptions. We show that sets of optimal milestones exist, i.e., sets such that successive transitions are indeed statistically independent. The proof of this claim relies on the results of transition path theory and uses the isocommittor surfaces of the reaction as milestones. For systems in the overdamped limit, we also obtain the probability distribution to reinitialize the MD trajectories on the milestones, and we discuss why this distribution is not available in closed form for systems with inertia. We explain why the time lags between transitions are not statistically independent even for optimal milestones, but we show that working with such milestones allows one to compute mean first passage times between milestones exactly. Finally, we discuss some practical implications of our results and we compare milestoning with Markov state models in view of our findings.},

abstract = {The absolute binding free energies and binding enthalpies of twelve host-guest systems in the SAMPL5 blind challenge were computed using our attach-pull-release (APR) approach. This method has previously shown good correlations between experimental and calculated binding data in retrospective studies of cucurbit[7] uril (CB7) and $\beta$-cyclodextrin ($\beta$CD) systems. In the present work, the computed binding free energies for host octa acid (OA or OAH) and tetra-endo-methyl octa-acid (TEMOA or OAMe) with guests are in good agreement with prospective experimental data, with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.8 and root-mean-squared error of 1.7 kcal/mol using the TIP3P water model. The binding enthalpy calculations achieve moderate correlations, with R(2) of 0.5 and RMSE of 2.5 kcal/mol, for TIP3P water. Calculations using the newly developed OPC water model also show good performance. Furthermore, the present calculations semi-quantitatively capture the experimental trend of enthalpy-entropy compensation observed, and successfully predict guests with the strongest and weakest binding affinity. The most populated binding poses of all twelve systems, based on clustering analysis of 750 ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, were extracted and analyzed. Computational methods using MD simulations and explicit solvent models in a rigorous statistical thermodynamic framework, like APR, can generate reasonable predictions of binding thermodynamics. Especially with continuing improvement in simulation force fields, such methods hold the promise of making substantial contributions to hit identification and lead optimization in the drug discovery process.},

This permeation rate is 9 orders of magnitude slower than the permeation rate of only a tryptophan side chain (computed by us and others). This difference suggests critical dependence of transport time on permeant size and hydrophilicity. Analysis of the simulation results suggests that the permeant partially preserves hydrogen bonding of the peptide backbone to water and lipid molecules even when it is moving closer to the bilayer center. As a consequence, defects of the membrane structure are developed to assist permeation.},

Despite their high potential as drug targets, the study of MPs has been hindered by limitations in expression, purification and stabilization in order to acquire thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of small molecules binding. These bottlenecks are grounded on the mandatory use of detergents to isolate and extract MPs from the cell plasma membrane and the coexistence of multiple conformations, which reflects biochemical versatility and intrinsic instability of MPs. In this work,we set out to define a new strategy to enable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements on a thermostabilized and truncated version of the human adenosine (A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2A{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) inserted in a lipid bilayer nanodisc in a label- and detergent-free manner by using a combination of affinity tags and GFP-based fluorescence techniques. We were able to detect and characterize small molecules binding kinetics on a GPCR fully embedded in a lipid environment. By providing a comparison between different binding assays in membranes, nanodiscs and detergent micelles, we show that nanodiscs can be used for small molecule binding studies by SPR to enhance the MP stability and to trigger a more native-like behaviour when compared to kinetics on A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2A{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} receptors isolated in detergent. This work provides thus a new methodology in drug discovery to characterize the binding kinetics of small molecule ligands for MPs targets in a lipid environment.},

abstract = {The Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster is a vital component of many oxidoreductases, including mitochondrial cytochrome bc1; its chloroplast equivalent, cytochrome b6f; one class of dioxygenases; and arsenite oxidase. The Rieske cluster acts as an electron shuttle and its reduction is believed to couple with protonation of one of the cluster's His ligands. In cytochromes bc1 and b6f, for example, the Rieske cluster acts as the first electron acceptor in a modified Q cycle. The protonation states of the cluster's His ligands determine its ability to accept a proton and possibly an electron through a hydrogen bond to the electron carrier, ubiquinol. Experimental determination of the protonation states of a Rieske cluster's two His ligands by NMR spectroscopy is difficult, due to the close proximity of the two paramagnetic iron atoms of the cluster. Therefore, this work reports density functional calculations and proposes that difference vibrational spectroscopy with (15) N isotopic substitution may be used to assign the protonation states of the His ligands of the oxidized Rieske [2Fe-2S] complex.},

abstract = {A goal in the kinetic characterization of a macromolecular system is the description of its slow relaxation processes via (i) identification of the structural changes involved in these processes and (ii) estimation of the rates or timescales at which these slow processes occur. Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive an optimal way of identifying the "slow subspace" of a large set of prior order parameters - either generic internal coordinates or a user-defined set of parameters. Using a variational formulation of conformational dynamics, it is shown that an existing method-the time-lagged independent component analysis-provides the optional solution to this problem. In addition, optimal indicators-order parameters indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction coordinates-are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the 30-residue intrinsically disordered peptide kinase inducible domain (KID). The identified optimal indicators reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the molecular system under analysis.},

abstract = {How drugs bind to their receptors--from initial association, through drug entry into the binding pocket, to adoption of the final bound conformation, or "pose"--has remained unknown, even for G-protein-coupled receptor modulators, which constitute one-third of all marketed drugs. We captured this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses matching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the $\beta$(1)- and $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptors, initially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor's extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distance of 15 {\AA} from the binding pocket, often presents the largest energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug-receptor binding and unbinding rates.},

However, the residence concept as presented in most papers is supported by rather misleading simulations and arguments, and by examples where compounds are taken out of their pharmacokinetic context. Moreover, fast association is typically more desirable than slow, and advantages of long residence time, notably a potential disconnect between pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), would be partially or completely offset by slow on-rate. Therefore, plain potency is likely a better predictor of drug development success than is residence time.},

@article{Chodera2007a,
abstract = {To meet the challenge of modeling the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules over long time scales, much recent effort has been devoted to constructing stochastic kinetic models, often in the form of discrete-state Markov models, from short molecular dynamics simulations. To construct useful models that faithfully represent dynamics at the time scales of interest, it is necessary to decompose configuration space into a set of kinetically metastable states. Previous attempts to define these states have relied upon either prior knowledge of the slow degrees of freedom or on the application of conformational clustering techniques which assume that conformationally distinct clusters are also kinetically distinct. Here, we present a first version of an automatic algorithm for the discovery of kinetically metastable states that is generally applicable to solvated macromolecules. Given molecular dynamics trajectories initiated from a well-defined starting distribution, the algorithm discovers long lived, kinetically metastable states through successive iterations of partitioning and aggregating conformation space into kinetically related regions. The authors apply this method to three peptides in explicit solvent-terminally blocked alanine, the 21-residue helical F(s) peptide, and the engineered 12-residue beta-hairpin trpzip2-to assess its ability to generate physically meaningful states and faithful kinetic models.},

abstract = {The steady-state kinetic properties of single Cl- channels with fast kinetics active at resting membrane potentials in cultured rat skeletal muscle were studied using the patch-clamp technique. Membrane patches containing single active Cl- channels were often observed, and binomial analysis of the percentage open time in membrane patches containing several Cl- channels indicated that the channels did not occur as obligatory dimers and that they gated independently of one another. Channel activity could be divided into three categories: normal, which included about 99{\%} of the openings and closings; buzz mode, which included about 1{\%} and consisted of bursts of about 50 brief open and shut intervals; and inactivated shut states which included about 0.01{\%} of the shut intervals and lasted for seconds, and occasionally minutes. The method of maximum likelihood was used to determine the number of significant exponential components required to fit the distributions of open and shut intervals during normal activity. Open interval distributions required at least two components, with time constants of 0.52 and 1.5 ms at -40 mV and 7.6 degrees C. Shut interval distributions required at least five exponential components, with time constants of 0.064, 0.72, 1.9, 12.3 and 350 ms. Kinetic reaction schemes were developed for the normal and buzz mode using maximum likelihood techniques to determine the most likely models and rate constants. In developing these models the effects of limited time resolution and missed events were taken into account. Each model tested typically had two or more sets of equally likely rate constants. Incorrect sets of rate constants resulting from the effect of missed events could be eliminated by analysis of the data with different time resolutions. Normal activity could be accounted for by several different seven-state models with two open and five shut states. As different models could be found that gave identical descriptions of the data, the distributions of open and shut intervals were not sufficient to define a unique model. It was established that no other seven-state models would be found that describe the distributions of open and shut intervals during normal activity better than the most likely presented models.},

The computation of the mean first passage time and additional low-order FPTD moments can be simplified by directly relating the FPTD moment generating function to the moments of the local FPTD matrix. This relationship can be physically interpreted in terms of steady-state relaxation, an extension of steady-state flow. Moreover, it is amenable to a statistical error analysis that can be used to significantly increase computational efficiency. The efficiency improvement can be extended to the FPTD itself by modelling it using a gamma distribution or rational function approximation to its Laplace transform.},

The kinetics of a conformational transition in a blocked alanine is computed and shown to be accurate, more efficient than straightforward molecular dynamics by a factor of about 9, and nonexponential. A general scaling argument predicts a linear speedup with the number of milestones for diffusive processes and an exponential speedup for transitions over barriers. The algorithm is also trivial to parallelize. As a side result, milestoning also produces the free energy profile along the reaction coordinate and is able to describe nonequilibrium motions along one (or a few) degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {A new milestoning procedure using Voronoi tessellations is proposed. In the new procedure, the edges of Voronoi cells are used as milestones, and the necessary kinetic information about the transitions between the milestones is calculated by running molecular dynamics ͑MD͒ simulations restricted to these cells. Like the traditional milestoning technique, the new procedure offers a reduced description of the original dynamics and permits to efficiently compute the various quantities necessary in this description. However, unlike traditional milestoning, the new procedure does not require to reinitialize trajectories from the milestones, and thereby it avoids the approximation made in traditional milestoning that the distribution for reinitialization is the equilibrium one. In this paper we concentrate on Markovian milestoning, which we show to be valid under suitable assumptions, and we explain how to estimate the rate matrix of transitions between the milestones from data collected from the MD trajectories in the Voronoi cells. The rate matrix can then be used to compute mean first passage times between milestones and reaction rates. The procedure is first illustrated on test-case examples in two dimensions and then applied to study the kinetics of protein insertion into a lipid bilayer by means of a coarse-grained model.},

Modeling ligand–receptor dissociation pathways can provide insights into molecular recognition and has practical applications, including understanding kinetic mechanisms and barriers to binding/unbinding as well as design of drugs with desired kinetic properties. PSIM uses PC modes in multilayer internal coordinates to identify natural molecular motions that guide the search for conformational switches and unbinding pathways. The new multilayer internal coordinates overcome problems with Cartesian and classical internal coordinates that fail to smoothly present dihedral rotation or generate nonphysical distortions.

abstract = {The kinetics of biochemical and biophysical events determined the course of life processes and attracted considerable interest and research. For example, modeling of biological networks and cellular responses relies on the availability of information on rate coefficients. Atomically detailed simulations hold the promise of supplementing experimental data to obtain a more complete kinetic picture. However, simulations at biological time scales are challenging. Typical computer resources are insufficient to provide the ensemble of trajectories at the correct length that is required for straightforward calculations of time scales. In the last years, new technologies emerged that make atomically detailed simulations of rate coefficients possible. Instead of computing complete trajectories from reactants to products, these approaches launch a large number of short trajectories at different positions. Since the trajectories are short, they are computed trivially in parallel on modern computer architecture. The starting and termination positions of the short trajectories are chosen, following statistical mechanics theory, to enhance efficiency. These trajectories are analyzed. The analysis produces accurate estimates of time scales as long as hours. The theory of Milestoning that exploits the use of short trajectories is discussed, and several applications are described.},

abstract = {We investigated the dissociation process of tri-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine from hen egg white lysozyme using parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD), which comprises cycles of multiple unbiased MD simulations using a selection of MD snapshots as the initial structures for the next cycle. Dissociation was significantly accelerated by PaCS-MD, in which the probability of rare event occurrence toward dissociation was enhanced by the selection and re-randomization of the initial velocities. Although this complex was stable during 1 $\mu$s of conventional MD, PaCS-MD easily induced dissociation within 100 – 101 ns. We found that velocity re-randomization enhances the dissociation of triNAG from the bound state, whereas diffusion plays a more important role in the unbound state. We calculated the dissociation free energy by analyzing all PaCS-MD trajectories using the Markov state model (MSM) and compared the results to those obtained by combinations of PaCS-MD and umbrella sampling (US), steered MD (SMD) and US, SMD and the Jarzynski equality, and experimentally determined binding free energy. PaCS-MD/MSM yielded results most comparable to the experimentally determined binding free energy, was independent of simulation parameter variations, and also gave the lowest standard errors.},

Here, we demonstrate an automatic, iterative, on-the-fly method for learning and sampling molecular simulations in the context of ligand binding for the case of trypsin–benzamidine binding. The method uses Markov state models to learn a simplified model of the simulations and decide where best to sample from, achieving a converged binding affinity in approximately one microsecond, 1 order of magnitude faster than classical sampling.

Up to now, it has been an open question as to how this coarse graining in space can be transformed to a coarse graining of the Markov chain while preserving the essential dynamic information. In this article, we construct a coarse matrix that is the correct propagator in the space of conformations. This coarse graining procedure carries over to rate matrices and allows to extract transition rates between molecular conformations. This approach is based on the fact that PCCA+ computes molecular conformations as linear combinations of the dominant eigenvectors of the transition matrix. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A new theory and an exact computer algorithm for calculating kinetics and thermodynamic properties of a particle system are described. The algorithm avoids trapping in metastable states, which are typical challenges for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on rough energy landscapes. It is based on the division of the full space into Voronoi cells. Prior knowledge or coarse sampling of space points provides the centers of the Voronoi cells. Short time trajectories are computed between the boundaries of the cells that we call milestones and are used to determine fluxes at the milestones. The flux function, an essential component of the new theory, provides a complete description of the statistical mechanics of the system at the resolution of the milestones. We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the exact Milestoning approach by comparing numerical results obtained on a model system using exact Milestoning with the results of long trajectories and with a solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. The theory uses an equation that resembles the approximate Milestoning method that was introduced in 2004 [A. K. Faradjian and R. Elber, J. Chem. Phys. 120(23), 10880-10889 (2004)].

abstract = {An improved and simplified version of the finite temperature string (FTS) method [W. E, W. Ren, and E. Vanden-Eijnden, J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 6688 (2005)] is proposed. Like the original approach, the new method is a scheme to calculate the principal curves associated with the Boltzmann-Gibbs probability distribution of the system, i.e., the curves which are such that their intersection with the hyperplanes perpendicular to themselves coincides with the expected position of the system in these planes (where perpendicular is understood with respect to the appropriate metric). Unlike more standard paths such as the minimum energy path or the minimum free energy path, the location of the principal curve depends on global features of the energy or the free energy landscapes and thereby may remain appropriate in situations where the landscape is rough on the thermal energy scale and/or entropic effects related to the width of the reaction channels matter. Instead of using constrained sampling in hyperplanes as in the original FTS, the new method calculates the principal curve via sampling in the Voronoi tessellation whose generating points are the discretization points along this curve. As shown here, this modification results in greater algorithmic simplicity. As a by-product, it also gives the free energy associated with the Voronoi tessellation. The new method can be applied both in the original Cartesian space of the system or in a set of collective variables. We illustrate FTS on test-case examples and apply it to the study of conformational transitions of the nitrogen regulatory protein C receiver domain using an elastic network model and to the isomerization of solvated alanine dipeptide.},

abstract = {The understanding of protein-ligand binding is of critical importance for biomedical research, yet the process itself has been very difficult to study because of its intrinsically dynamic character. Here, we have been able to quantitatively reconstruct the complete binding process of the enzyme-inhibitor complex trypsin-benzamidine by performing 495 molecular dynamics simulations of free ligand binding of 100 ns each, 187 of which produced binding events with an rmsd less than 2 Å compared to the crystal structure. The binding paths obtained are able to capture the kinetic pathway of the inhibitor diffusing from solvent (S0) to the bound (S4) state passing through two metastable intermediate states S2 and S3. Rather than directly entering the binding pocket the inhibitor appears to roll on the surface of the protein in its transition between S3 and the final binding pocket, whereas the transition between S2 and the bound pose requires rediffusion to S3. An estimation of the standard free energy of binding gives $\Delta$G° = -5.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mol (cf. the experimental value -6.2 kcal/mol), and a two-states kinetic model k(on) = (1.5 ± 0.2) × 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) and k(off) = (9.5 ± 3.3) × 10(4) s(-1) for unbound to bound transitions. The ability to reconstruct by simple diffusion the binding pathway of an enzyme-inhibitor binding process demonstrates the predictive power of unconventional high-throughput molecular simulations. Moreover, the methodology is directly applicable to other molecular systems and thus of general interest in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.},

Using the dissociation of 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]-pyridines from the focal adhesion kinase as an example, this work finds that steered molecular dynamics simulations could help screen compounds with long-residence times. It also reveals a two-step mechanism of ligand dissociation resembling the release of ADP from protein kinase A reported earlier. A phenyl group attaching to the pyrrole prolongs residence time by creating a large activation barrier for transition from the bound to the intermediate state when it becomes exposed to the solvent. Principal component analysis shows that ligand dissociation does not couple with large-scale collective motions of the protein involving many of its amino acids. Rather, a small subset of amino acids dominates. Some of these amino acids do not contact the ligands directly along the dissociation pathways and could exert long-range allosteric effects. {\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A single relaxational phenomenon was observed only when the solutes were coexisting, although no relaxation was found in the beta-CD solution or in the acid solutions. The absorption was also measured in a solution of pentanoic acid (dissociated form) with beta-CD, and single relaxation was detected. The ultrasonic relaxation observed in these solutions was due to a perturbation of a chemical equilibrium related to a reaction of an inclusion complex formed by the host and guest. The equilibrium constant was obtained from the dependence of the maximum absorption per wavelength on the guest concentration. The rate constant for the inclusion process of the guest into a cavity of beta-CD and that for the leaving process from the cavity were determined from the obtained relaxation frequency and the equilibrium constant. The standard volume change of the reaction was also computed from the maximum absorption per wavelength. These results were compared with those in solutions containing both beta-CD and different guest molecules. It was found that the hydrophobicity of guest molecules played an important role in the formation of the inclusion complex and also that the charge on the carboxylic group had a considerable effect on the kinetic characteristics of the complexation reaction.},

The algorithm generates rare events by dividing the coordinate space into regions, on-the-fly, and balancing computational effort between regions through cloning and merging steps, as in the weighted ensemble method. The averaged exit flux yields a ligand exit rate of 180 $\mu$s, which is within an order of magnitude of the experimental value. We obtain broad sampling of ligand exit pathways, and visualize our findings using conformation space networks. The analysis shows three distinct exit channels, two of which are formed through large, rare motions of the loop regions in trypsin. This broad set of ligand-bound poses is then used to investigate general properties of ligand binding: we observe both a direct stabilizing effect of ligand-protein interactions and an indirect destabilizing effect on intraprotein interactions that is induced by the ligand. Significantly, the crystallographic binding poses are distinguished not only because their ligands induce large stabilizing effects, but also because they induce relatively low indirect destabilizations.},

The theory uses an equation that resembles the approximate Milestoning method that was introduced in 2004 [A. K. Faradjian and R. Elber, J. Chem. Phys. 120(23), 10880-10889 (2004)]. However, the current formulation is exact and is still significantly more efficient than straightforward MD simulations on the system studied.},

They provide a simple picture of reaction progress and essential input for calculations of free energies and rates. Iso-committor surfaces are considered the optimal reaction coordinate. We present an algorithm to compute efficiently a sequence of isocommittor surfaces. These surfaces are considered an optimal reaction coordinate. The algorithm analyzes Milestoning results to determine the committor function. It requires only the transition probabilities between the milestones, and not transition times. We discuss the following numerical examples: (i) a transition in the Mueller potential; (ii) a conformational change of a solvated peptide; and (iii) cholesterol aggregation in membranes. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.},

abstract = {We use Markovian milestoning molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a tessellation of the collective variable space for CO localization in myoglobin to estimate the kinetics of entry, exit, and internal site-hopping. The tessellation is determined by analysis of the free-energy surface in that space using transition-path theory (TPT), which provides criteria for defining optimal milestones, allowing short, independent, cell-constrained MD simulations to provide properly weighted kinetic data. We coarse grain the resulting kinetic model at two levels: first, using crystallographically relevant internal cavities and their predicted interconnections and solvent portals; and second, as a three-state side-path scheme inspired by similar models developed from geminate recombination experiments. We show semiquantitative agreement with experiment on entry and exit rates and in the identification of the so-called "histidine gate" at position 64 through which ≈90{\%} of flux between solvent and the distal pocket passes. We also show with six-dimensional calculations that the minimum free-energy pathway of escape through the histidine gate is a "knock-on" mechanism in which motion of the ligand and the gate are sequential and interdependent. In total, these results suggest that such TPT simulations are indeed a promising approach to overcome the practical time-scale limitations of MD to allow reliable estimation of transition mechanisms and rates among metastable states.},

Seven metastable conformations with different binding pocket structures are found that interconvert at timescales of tens of microseconds. These conformations differ in their substrate-binding affinities and binding/dissociation rates. For each metastable state, corresponding solved structures of Trypsin mutants or similar serine proteases are contained in the protein data bank. Thus, our wild-type simulations explore a space of conformations that can be individually stabilized by adding ligands or making suitable changes in protein sequence.

Different charging conditions of the peptide (positive, negative, or zwitterion) are considered. Both experiment and simulation reproduce the qualitative trend and suggest that the fastest permeation is when the tryptophan is positively charged. The permeation mechanism, which is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations, is of a translocation assisted by a local defect.

abstract = {A new milestoning procedure using Voronoi tessellations is proposed. In the new procedure, the edges of Voronoi cells are used as milestones, and the necessary kinetic information about the transitions between the milestones is calculated by running molecular dynamics ͑MD͒ simulations restricted to these cells. Like the traditional milestoning technique, the new procedure offers a reduced description of the original dynamics and permits to efficiently compute the various quantities necessary in this description. However, unlike traditional milestoning, the new procedure does not require to reinitialize trajectories from the milestones, and thereby it avoids the approximation made in traditional milestoning that the distribution for reinitialization is the equilibrium one. In this paper we concentrate on Markovian milestoning, which we show to be valid under suitable assumptions, and we explain how to estimate the rate matrix of transitions between the milestones from data collected from the MD trajectories in the Voronoi cells. The rate matrix can then be used to compute mean first passage times between milestones and reaction rates. The procedure is first illustrated on test-case examples in two dimensions and then applied to study the kinetics of protein insertion into a lipid bilayer by means of a coarse-grained model.},

However, the residence concept as presented in most papers is supported by rather misleading simulations and arguments, and by examples where compounds are taken out of their pharmacokinetic context. Moreover, fast association is typically more desirable than slow, and advantages of long residence time, notably a potential disconnect between pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), would be partially or completely offset by slow on-rate. Therefore, plain potency is likely a better predictor of drug development success than is residence time.},

abstract = {Milestoning is a method for calculating kinetics and thermodynamics of long time processes typically not accessible for straightforward Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. In the Milestoning approach, the system of interest is partitioned into cells by dividing hypersurfaces (Milestones) and transitions are computed between nearby hypersurfaces. Kinetics and thermodynamics are derived from the statistics of these transitions. The original Milestoning work concentrated on systems in which a one-dimensional reaction coordinate or an order parameter could be identified. In many biomolecular processes the reaction proceeds via multiple channels or following more than a single order parameter. A description based on a one-dimensional reaction coordinate may be insufficient. In the present paper we introduce a variation that overcomes this limitation.Following the ideas of Vanden-Eijnden and Venturoli on Voronoi cells that avoid the use of an order parameter (J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 194101), we describe another way to "Milestone" systems without a reaction coordinate. We examine the assumptions of the Milestoning calculations of mean first passage times (MFPT) and describe strategies to weaken these assumptions. The method described in this paper, Directional Milestoning, arranges hypersurfaces in higher dimensions that "tag" trajectories such that efficient calculations can be done and at the same time the assumptions required for exact calculations of MFPTs are satisfied approximately.In the original Milestoning papers trajectories are initiated from an equilibrium set of conformations. Here a more accurate distribution, that mimics the first hitting point distribution, is used. We demonstrate the usage of Directional Milestoning in conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide (in vacuum and in aqueous solution) and compare the correctness, efficiency, and statistical stability of the method with exact MD and with a related method.},

@article{Chiu2016,
abstract = {One of the unaddressed challenges in drug discovery is that drug potency determined in vitro is not a reliable indicator of drug activity in vivo. Accumulated evidence suggests that in vivo activity is more strongly correlated with the binding/unbinding kinetics than the equilibrium thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions (PLI). However, existing experimental and computational techniques are insufficient in studying the molecular details of kinetics process of PLI. Consequently, we not only have limited mechanistic understanding of the kinetic process but also lack a practical platform for the high-throughput screening and optimization of drug leads based on their kinetic properties. For the first time, we address this unmet need by integrating coarse-grained normal mode analysis with multi-target machine learning (MTML). To test our method, HIV-1 protease is used as a model system. We find that computational models based on the residue normal mode directionality displacement of PLI can not only recapitulate the results from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, but also predict protein-ligand binding/unbinding kinetics accurately. When combined with energetic features, the accuracy of combined kon and koff prediction reaches 74.35{\%}, and the accuracy for compound screening with in vivo drug activity has an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9435. Furthermore, our integrated model provides us with new insights into the molecular determinants of kinetics of PLI. We propose that the coherent coupling of conformational dynamics and thermodynamic interactions between receptor and ligand may play a critical role in determining the kinetic rate constants of PLI. In conclusion, we demonstrate that residue normal mode directionality displacement can serve as a kinetic fingerprint to capture long-time scale conformational dynamics of the binding/unbinding kinetics. Coupled with the MTML, it is possible to screen and optimize compounds based on their binding/unbinding kinetics in a high-throughput fashion. The further development of such computational tools will bridge one of the critical missing links between in vitro compound screening and in vivo drug activity.},

abstract = {Drug discovery is expensive and high-risk. Its main reasons of failure are lack of efficacy and toxicity of a drug candidate. Binding affinity for the biological target has been usually considered one of the most relevant figures of merit to judge a drug candidate along with bioavailability, selectivity and metabolic properties, which could depend on off-target interactions. Nevertheless, affinity does not always satisfactorily correlate with in vivo drug efficacy. It is indeed becoming increasingly evident that the time a drug spends in contact with its target (aka residence time) can be a more reliable figure of merit. Experimental kinetic measurements are operatively limited by the cost and the time needed to synthesize compounds to be tested, to express and purify the target, and to setup the assays. We present here a simple and efficient molecular-dynamics-based computational approach to prioritize compounds according to their residence time. We devised a multiple-replica scaled molecular dynamics protocol with suitably defined harmonic restraints to accelerate the unbinding events while preserving the native fold. Ligands are ranked according to the mean observed scaled unbinding time. The approach, trivially parallel and easily implementable, was validated against experimental information available on biological systems of pharmacological relevance.},

abstract = {The kinetic rate constants of binding were estimated for four biochemically relevant molecular systems by a method that uses milestoning theory to combine Brownian dynamics simulations with more detailed molecular dynamics simulations. The rate constants found using this method agreed well with experimentally and theoretically obtained values. We predicted the association rate of a small charged molecule toward both a charged and an uncharged spherical receptor and verified the estimated value with Smoluchowski theory. We also calculated the kon rate constant for superoxide dismutase with its natural substrate, O2-, in a validation of a previous experiment using similar methods but with a number of important improvements. We also calculated the kon for a new system: the N-terminal domain of Troponin C with its natural substrate Ca2+. The kon calculated for the latter two systems closely resemble experimentally obtained values. This novel multiscale approach is computationally cheaper and more parallelizable when compared to other methods of similar accuracy. We anticipate that this methodology will be useful for predicting kinetic rate constants and for understanding the process of binding between a small molecule and a protein receptor.},

Time dependent spectroscopy of the tryptophan side chain determines the rate of permeation into 150 nm phospholipid vesicles. Atomically detailed simulations are conducted to calculate the free energy profiles and the permeation coefficient. Different charging conditions of the peptide (positive, negative, or zwitterion) are considered. Both experiment and simulation reproduce the qualitative trend and suggest that the fastest permeation is when the tryptophan is positively charged. The permeation mechanism, which is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations, is of a translocation assisted by a local defect. The influence of long-range electrostatic interactions, such as the membrane dipole potential on the permeation process, is not significant.},

Experimental and theoretical analyses of the role of changes in HIV reverse transcriptase structure in selecting a correct substrate are presented. Atomically detailed simulations using the Milestoning method predict a rate and free energy profile of the conformational change commensurate with experimental data. A large conformational change occurring on a millisecond timescale locks the correct nucleotide at the active site but promotes release of a mismatched nucleotide. The positions along the reaction coordinate that decide the yield of the reaction are not determined by the chemical step. Rather, the initial steps of weak substrate binding and protein conformational transition significantly enrich the yield of a reaction with a correct substrate, whereas the same steps diminish the reaction probability of an incorrect substrate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Most often, the effectiveness of interaction between a receptor and its ligand is quantified in terms of closed system, equilibrium affinity measurements, such as IC50 and Kd. In the context of in vivo biology, however, the extent and duration of responses to receptor-ligand interactions depend greatly on the time period over which the ligand is in residence on its receptor. Here we define receptor-ligand complex residence time in quantitative terms and describe its significance to biological function. Examples of the importance of residence time are presented for natural ligands of different receptor types. The impact of residence time on the optimization of potential ligands as drugs for human medicine is also described.},

abstract = {We use Markovian milestoning molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a tessellation of the collective variable space for CO localization in myoglobin to estimate the kinetics of entry, exit, and internal site-hopping. The tessellation is determined by analysis of the free-energy surface in that space using transition-path theory (TPT), which provides criteria for defining optimal milestones, allowing short, independent, cell-constrained MD simulations to provide properly weighted kinetic data. We coarse grain the resulting kinetic model at two levels: first, using crystallographically relevant internal cavities and their predicted interconnections and solvent portals; and second, as a three-state side-path scheme inspired by similar models developed from geminate recombination experiments. We show semiquantitative agreement with experiment on entry and exit rates and in the identification of the so-called "histidine gate" at position 64 through which ≈90{\%} of flux between solvent and the distal pocket passes. We also show with six-dimensional calculations that the minimum free-energy pathway of escape through the histidine gate is a "knock-on" mechanism in which motion of the ligand and the gate are sequential and interdependent. In total, these results suggest that such TPT simulations are indeed a promising approach to overcome the practical time-scale limitations of MD to allow reliable estimation of transition mechanisms and rates among metastable states.},

Experimental approaches to binding and unbinding kinetics are nowadays available, but we still lack reliable computational tools for predicting kinetics and residence time. Most attempts have been based on brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are CPU-demanding and not yet particularly accurate. We recently reported a new scaled- MD-based protocol, which showed potential for residence time prediction in drug discovery. Here, we further challenged our procedure's predictive ability by applying our methodology to a series of glucokinase activators that could be useful for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. We combined scaled MD with experimental kinetics measurements and X-ray crystallography, promptly checking the protocol's reliability by directly comparing computational predictions and experimental measures. The good agreement highlights the potential of our scaled-MD-based approach as an innovative method for computationally estimating and predicting drug residence times.},

The permeation of a blocked tryptophan through a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) membrane is investigated to probe unassisted or physical transport. The transport rate is measured experimentally and modeled computationally. The time scale measured by parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA) experiments is {\~{}}8 h. Simulations with the milestoning algorithm suggest mean first passage time (MFPT) of {\~{}}4 h and the presence of a large barrier at the center of the bilayer. A similar calculation with the solubility-diffusion model yields a MFPT of {\~{}}15 min. This permeation rate is 9 orders of magnitude slower than the permeation rate of only a tryptophan side chain (computed by us and others). This difference suggests critical dependence of transport time on permeant size and hydrophilicity. Analysis of the simulation results suggests that the permeant partially preserves hydrogen bonding of the peptide backbone to water and lipid molecules even when it is moving closer to the bilayer center. As a consequence, defects of the membrane structure are developed to assist permeation.},

abstract = {A single ultrasonic relaxational phenomenon was observed in aqueous solutions containing both beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) as host and nonionized or ionized acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) as guest. The observed relaxation was responsible for a dynamic complexation reaction between beta-CD and aspirin molecules, concomitant with a volume change during the reaction. The kinetic and equilibrium constants for the complexation in the acid (nonionized) form of the aspirin system were derived from the guest concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency. The equilibrium constant for the carboxylate (ionized) form of aspirin was determined from the concentration dependence of a maximum absorption per wavelength, and the rate constants were calculated by using the determined equilibrium constant and the observed relaxation frequencies, which remained nearly almost constant over the concentration range studied. The results showed that the effect of charge on the aspirin molecule was reflected only in the dissociation process from the beta-CD cavity, while no remarkable change was seen in the association process whose rate was diffusion controlled. The results could be explained on the basis of the difference of the hydrophobic moieties in the two guests that were included in the host cavity. The results of the standard volume change for the complexation reaction were closely related to the number of expelled water molecules originally located in the beta-CD cavity and the volume of the aspirin molecule incorporated into the beta-CD cavity.},

Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the N lobe dimerization interface of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is intrinsically disordered and that it becomes ordered only upon dimerization. Our simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing activation without dimerization. We also find that phosphorylation of EGFR kinase domain at Tyr845 may suppress the intrinsic disorder, suggesting a molecular mechanism for autonomous EGFR signaling.},

abstract = {A new theory and an exact computer algorithm for calculating kinetics and thermodynamic properties of a particle system are described. The algorithm avoids trapping in metastable states, which are typical challenges for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on rough energy landscapes. It is based on the division of the full space into Voronoi cells. Prior knowledge or coarse sampling of space points provides the centers of the Voronoi cells. Short time trajectories are computed between the boundaries of the cells that we call milestones and are used to determine fluxes at the milestones. The flux function, an essential component of the new theory, provides a complete description of the statistical mechanics of the system at the resolution of the milestones. We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the exact Milestoning approach by comparing numerical results obtained on a model system using exact Milestoning with the results of long trajectories and with a solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. The theory uses an equation that resembles the approximate Milestoning method that was introduced in 2004 [A. K. Faradjian and R. Elber, J. Chem. Phys. 120(23), 10880-10889 (2004)]. However, the current formulation is exact and is still significantly more efficient than straightforward MD simulations on the system studied.},

abstract = {The kinetics of biochemical and biophysical events determined the course of life processes and attracted considerable interest and research. For example, modeling of biological networks and cellular responses relies on the availability of information on rate coefficients. Atomically detailed simulations hold the promise of supplementing experimental data to obtain a more complete kinetic picture. However, simulations at biological time scales are challenging. Typical computer resources are insufficient to provide the ensemble of trajectories at the correct length that is required for straightforward calculations of time scales. In the last years, new technologies emerged that make atomically detailed simulations of rate coefficients possible. Instead of computing complete trajectories from reactants to products, these approaches launch a large number of short trajectories at different positions. Since the trajectories are short, they are computed trivially in parallel on modern computer architecture. The starting and termination positions of the short trajectories are chosen, following statistical mechanics theory, to enhance efficiency. These trajectories are analyzed. The analysis produces accurate estimates of time scales as long as hours. The theory of Milestoning that exploits the use of short trajectories is discussed, and several applications are described.},

abstract = {A new milestoning procedure using Voronoi tessellations is proposed. In the new procedure, the edges of Voronoi cells are used as milestones, and the necessary kinetic information about the transitions between the milestones is calculated by running molecular dynamics ͑MD͒ simulations restricted to these cells. Like the traditional milestoning technique, the new procedure offers a reduced description of the original dynamics and permits to efficiently compute the various quantities necessary in this description. However, unlike traditional milestoning, the new procedure does not require to reinitialize trajectories from the milestones, and thereby it avoids the approximation made in traditional milestoning that the distribution for reinitialization is the equilibrium one. In this paper we concentrate on Markovian milestoning, which we show to be valid under suitable assumptions, and we explain how to estimate the rate matrix of transitions between the milestones from data collected from the MD trajectories in the Voronoi cells. The rate matrix can then be used to compute mean first passage times between milestones and reaction rates. The procedure is first illustrated on test-case examples in two dimensions and then applied to study the kinetics of protein insertion into a lipid bilayer by means of a coarse-grained model.},

Here, we demonstrate an automatic, iterative, on-the-fly method for learning and sampling molecular simulations in the context of ligand binding for the case of trypsin–benzamidine binding. The method uses Markov state models to learn a simplified model of the simulations and decide where best to sample from, achieving a converged binding affinity in approximately one microsecond, 1 order of magnitude faster than classical sampling.

abstract = {Ring-shaped, hexameric ATPase motors fulfill key functions in cellular processes, such as genome replication, transcription, or protein degradation, by translocating a long substrate through their central pore powered by ATP hydrolysis. Despite intense research efforts, the atomic-level mechanism transmitting chemical energy from hydrolysis into mechanical force that translocates the substrate is still unclear. Here we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with advanced path sampling techniques and milestoning analysis to characterize how mRNA substrate is translocated by an exemplary homohexameric motor, the transcription termination factor Rho. We find that the release of hydrolysis product (ADP + Pi) triggers the force-generating process of Rho through a 0.1 millisecond-long conformational transition, the time scale seen also in experiment. The calculated free energy profiles and kinetics show that Rho unidirectionally translocates the single-stranded RNA substrate via a population shift of the conformational states of Rho; upon hydrolysis product release, the most favorable conformation shifts from the pretranslocation state to the post-translocation state. Via two previously unidentified intermediate states, the RNA chain is seen to be pulled by six K326 side chains, whose motions are induced by highly coordinated relative translation and rotation of Rho's six subunits. The present study not only reveals in new detail the mechanism employed by ring-shaped ATPase motors, for example the use of loosely bound and tightly bound hydrolysis reactant and product states to coordinate motor action, but also provides an effective approach to identify allosteric sites of multimeric enzymes in general.},

abstract = {Milestoning is a method for calculating kinetics and thermodynamics of long time processes typically not accessible for straightforward Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. In the Milestoning approach, the system of interest is partitioned into cells by dividing hypersurfaces (Milestones) and transitions are computed between nearby hypersurfaces. Kinetics and thermodynamics are derived from the statistics of these transitions. The original Milestoning work concentrated on systems in which a one-dimensional reaction coordinate or an order parameter could be identified. In many biomolecular processes the reaction proceeds via multiple channels or following more than a single order parameter. A description based on a one-dimensional reaction coordinate may be insufficient. In the present paper we introduce a variation that overcomes this limitation.Following the ideas of Vanden-Eijnden and Venturoli on Voronoi cells that avoid the use of an order parameter (J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 194101), we describe another way to "Milestone" systems without a reaction coordinate. We examine the assumptions of the Milestoning calculations of mean first passage times (MFPT) and describe strategies to weaken these assumptions. The method described in this paper, Directional Milestoning, arranges hypersurfaces in higher dimensions that "tag" trajectories such that efficient calculations can be done and at the same time the assumptions required for exact calculations of MFPTs are satisfied approximately.In the original Milestoning papers trajectories are initiated from an equilibrium set of conformations. Here a more accurate distribution, that mimics the first hitting point distribution, is used. We demonstrate the usage of Directional Milestoning in conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide (in vacuum and in aqueous solution) and compare the correctness, efficiency, and statistical stability of the method with exact MD and with a related method.},

abstract = {How drugs bind to their receptors--from initial association, through drug entry into the binding pocket, to adoption of the final bound conformation, or "pose"--has remained unknown, even for G-protein-coupled receptor modulators, which constitute one-third of all marketed drugs. We captured this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses matching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the $\beta$(1)- and $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptors, initially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor's extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distance of 15 {\AA} from the binding pocket, often presents the largest energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug-receptor binding and unbinding rates.},

We also calculated the kon for a new system: the N-terminal domain of Troponin C with its natural substrate Ca2+. The kon calculated for the latter two systems closely resemble experimentally obtained values.

The kinetics of a conformational transition in a blocked alanine is computed and shown to be accurate, more efficient than straightforward molecular dynamics by a factor of about 9, and nonexponential.

abstract = {Understanding the fine balance between changes of entropy and enthalpy and the competition between a guest and water molecules in molecular binding is crucial in fundamental studies and practical applications. Experiments provide measurements. However, illustrating the binding/unbinding processes gives a complete picture of molecular recognition not directly available from experiments, and computational methods bridge the gaps. Here, we investigated guest association/dissociation with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) by using microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, post-analysis and numerical calculations. We computed association and dissociation rate constants, enthalpy, and solvent and solute entropy of binding. All the computed values of kon, koff, $\Delta$H, $\Delta$S, and $\Delta$G could be compared with experimental data directly and agreed reasonably with experiment findings. Water molecules play a crucial role in guest binding to beta-CD. Collective water/beta-CD motions could contribute to different computed kon and $\Delta$H values by using GAFF-CD and q4MD-CD force fields for beta-CD, mainly because of the motion of beta-CD that provides different hydrogen-bond networks of water molecules in the cavity of free beta-CD and the strength of desolvation penalty. Both force fields resulted in similar computed $\Delta$G from independently computed kinetics rates and thermodynamics properties ($\Delta$H, $\Delta$S) and suggest the same driving forces of binding, non-polar attractions between solutes and entropy gain of desolvating water molecules. However, the balances of $\Delta$H and -T$\Delta$S and enthalpy-entropy compensation are not identical. The study further interprets experiments, deepens our understanding of ligand binding, and suggests strategies for force field parameterization.},

abstract = {The complexation behavior of 1-naphthyl-1-ethanol (1-NpOH) and 2-naphthyl-1-ethanol (2-NpOH) with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was studied by employing several spectroscopic techniques. In the case of 1-NpOH, only a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry is formed with beta-CD, which. has an equilibrium constant that is smaller than that observed for the 1:1 complex between beta-CD and 2-NpOH. Excimer emission was observed in the presence of beta-CD for solutions containing high 2-NpOH concentrations. This excimer emission was ascribed to a complex with 2:2 beta-CD/2-NpOH stoichiometry. In addition, H-1 NMR data suggest that 2-NpOH is axially incorporated into the beta-CD cavity. Only in the case of 2-NpOH was a broadening of the signals corresponding to the aromatic protons observed in the presence of beta-CD. This broadening was attributed to the formation of the 2:2 complex. The dynamics of NpOH complexation was investigated by using the quenching methodology for triplet states. The entry rate constants for the 1:1 complex of 1-NpOH and 2-NpOH are (4.7 +/- 1.9) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) and (2.9 +/- 1.6) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively, whereas the exit rate constants for the two compounds are (4.8 +/- 1.8) x 10(5) s(-1) and (1.8 +/- 0.7) x 10(5) s(-1). In the case of 2-NpOH, we were able for the first time to estimate the rate constant for the dissociation of a beta-CD 2:2 complex ((0.2-2.5) x 10(3) s(-1)), showing that the dynamics for complexes including more than one cyclodextrin are remarkably slower than the dynamics observed for 1:1 complexes.},

abstract = {The understanding of protein-ligand binding is of critical importance for biomedical research, yet the process itself has been very difficult to study because of its intrinsically dynamic character. Here, we have been able to quantitatively reconstruct the complete binding process of the enzyme-inhibitor complex trypsin-benzamidine by performing 495 molecular dynamics simulations of free ligand binding of 100 ns each, 187 of which produced binding events with an rmsd less than 2 Å compared to the crystal structure. The binding paths obtained are able to capture the kinetic pathway of the inhibitor diffusing from solvent (S0) to the bound (S4) state passing through two metastable intermediate states S2 and S3. Rather than directly entering the binding pocket the inhibitor appears to roll on the surface of the protein in its transition between S3 and the final binding pocket, whereas the transition between S2 and the bound pose requires rediffusion to S3. An estimation of the standard free energy of binding gives $\Delta$G° = -5.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mol (cf. the experimental value -6.2 kcal/mol), and a two-states kinetic model k(on) = (1.5 ± 0.2) × 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) and k(off) = (9.5 ± 3.3) × 10(4) s(-1) for unbound to bound transitions. The ability to reconstruct by simple diffusion the binding pathway of an enzyme-inhibitor binding process demonstrates the predictive power of unconventional high-throughput molecular simulations. Moreover, the methodology is directly applicable to other molecular systems and thus of general interest in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.},

We provide a thorough description of the ligand unbinding pathway identifying the most stable binding mode and other thermodynamically relevant poses.

A single relaxational absorption was found, although it was not observed in the absence of beta-CD. The cause of the relaxation was attributed to a perturbation of a chemical equilibrium associated with an interaction between propionic acid and beta-CD. The rate and thermodynamic constants for the association and dissociation reaction for the complex were determined from the concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency and the maximum absorption per wavelength. It was found that the complex formed by beta-CD and propionic acid is more stable when the acid is in undissociated form. Further, the ultrasonic relaxation associated with a proton-transfer reaction was also observed when no additive exists in the solution. The rate and thermodynamic parameters were also determined precisely. [References: 16]},

Here we analyze a variant of this procedure, termed optimal milestoning, which relies on a specific choice of milestones to capture exactly some kinetic features of the original dynamical system. In particular, we prove that optimal milestoning permits the exact calculation of the mean first passage times (MFPT) between any two milestones. In so doing, we also analyze another variant of the method, called exact milestoning, which also permits the exact calculation of certain MFPTs, but at the price of retaining more information about the original system's dynamics. Finally, we discuss importance sampling strategies based on optimal and exact milestoning that can be used to bypass the simulation of the original system when estimating the statistical quantities used in these methods.},

abstract = {An improved and simplified version of the finite temperature string (FTS) method [W. E, W. Ren, and E. Vanden-Eijnden, J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 6688 (2005)] is proposed. Like the original approach, the new method is a scheme to calculate the principal curves associated with the Boltzmann-Gibbs probability distribution of the system, i.e., the curves which are such that their intersection with the hyperplanes perpendicular to themselves coincides with the expected position of the system in these planes (where perpendicular is understood with respect to the appropriate metric). Unlike more standard paths such as the minimum energy path or the minimum free energy path, the location of the principal curve depends on global features of the energy or the free energy landscapes and thereby may remain appropriate in situations where the landscape is rough on the thermal energy scale and/or entropic effects related to the width of the reaction channels matter. Instead of using constrained sampling in hyperplanes as in the original FTS, the new method calculates the principal curve via sampling in the Voronoi tessellation whose generating points are the discretization points along this curve. As shown here, this modification results in greater algorithmic simplicity. As a by-product, it also gives the free energy associated with the Voronoi tessellation. The new method can be applied both in the original Cartesian space of the system or in a set of collective variables. We illustrate FTS on test-case examples and apply it to the study of conformational transitions of the nitrogen regulatory protein C receiver domain using an elastic network model and to the isomerization of solvated alanine dipeptide.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic absorption method was applied to elucidate the dynamic properties of host-guest complexation between $\alpha$-cyclodextrin or $\beta$-cyclodextrin (host) and butanol isomers (guest) at 25°C. The aim of this work was to reveal the effect of a structural difference in the hydrophobic part of a guest on the kinetic parameters for an inclusion reaction with cyclodextrins. Moreover, it was expected to clarify the effect of the cavity size on the reaction. Only when the host and guest existed together in water, a clear single relaxational phenomenon was observed. The cause of the relaxation was responsible for the complexation reaction between the host and the guest. The rate and equilibrium constants were obtained from the concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency, and the standard volume changes of the complexation reaction were from the maximum absorption per wavelength. The backward rate constant, kb- was very dependent on the structure of the guest molecule. The kb value decreased in the next hydrophobic series, nor- {\textless} sec- {\textless} tert- in $\beta$-CD systems, although a smaller kb value was observed when the guest possessed a normal carbon chain in $\alpha$-CD systems. The results of the volume change of the reaction implied that $\alpha$-CD could only include a guest quite shallowly, and almost the entire guest molecule was included into the $\beta$-CD cavity.},

@article{Cardenas2012,
abstract = {Cellular transport machinery, such as channels and pumps, is working against the background of unassisted material transport through membranes. The permeation of a blocked tryptophan through a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) membrane is investigated to probe unassisted or physical transport. The transport rate is measured experimentally and modeled computationally. The time scale measured by parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA) experiments is {\~{}}8 h. Simulations with the milestoning algorithm suggest mean first passage time (MFPT) of {\~{}}4 h and the presence of a large barrier at the center of the bilayer. A similar calculation with the solubility-diffusion model yields a MFPT of {\~{}}15 min. This permeation rate is 9 orders of magnitude slower than the permeation rate of only a tryptophan side chain (computed by us and others). This difference suggests critical dependence of transport time on permeant size and hydrophilicity. Analysis of the simulation results suggests that the permeant partially preserves hydrogen bonding of the peptide backbone to water and lipid molecules even when it is moving closer to the bilayer center. As a consequence, defects of the membrane structure are developed to assist permeation.},

abstract = {The binding of ligands with their molecular receptors is of tremendous importance in biology. Although much emphasis has been placed on characterizing binding sites and bound poses that determine the binding thermodynamics, the pathway by which a ligand binds importantly determines the binding kinetics. The computational study of entire unbiased ligand binding and release pathways is still an emerging field, made possible only recently by advances in computational hardware and sampling methodologies. We have developed one such method (WExplore) that is based on a weighted ensemble of trajectories, which we apply to ligand release for the first time, using a set of three previously characterized interactions between low-affinity ligands and the protein FKBP-12 (FK-506 binding protein). WExplore is found to be more efficient that conventional sampling, even for the nanosecond-scale unbinding events observed here. From a nonequilibrium ensemble of unbinding trajectories, we obtain ligand residence times and ...},

@article{Tang2017e,
abstract = {Understanding the fine balance between changes of entropy and enthalpy and the competition between a guest and water molecules in molecular binding is crucial in fundamental studies and practical applications. Experiments provide measurements. However, illustrating the binding/unbinding processes gives a complete picture of molecular recognition not directly available from experiments, and computational methods bridge the gaps. Here, we investigated guest association/dissociation with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) by using microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, post-analysis and numerical calculations. We computed association and dissociation rate constants, enthalpy, and solvent and solute entropy of binding. All the computed values of kon, koff, $\Delta$H, $\Delta$S, and $\Delta$G could be compared with experimental data directly and agreed reasonably with experiment findings. Water molecules play a crucial role in guest binding to beta-CD. Collective water/beta-CD motions could contribute to different computed kon and $\Delta$H values by using GAFF-CD and q4MD-CD force fields for beta-CD, mainly because of the motion of beta-CD that provides different hydrogen-bond networks of water molecules in the cavity of free beta-CD and the strength of desolvation penalty. Both force fields resulted in similar computed $\Delta$G from independently computed kinetics rates and thermodynamics properties ($\Delta$H, $\Delta$S) and suggest the same driving forces of binding, non-polar attractions between solutes and entropy gain of desolvating water molecules. However, the balances of $\Delta$H and -T$\Delta$S and enthalpy-entropy compensation are not identical. The study further interprets experiments, deepens our understanding of ligand binding, and suggests strategies for force field parameterization.},

We conducted relatively long, unguided molecular dynamics simulations in which a ligand (the cancer drug dasatinib or the kinase inhibitor PP1) was initially placed at a random location within a box that also contained a protein (Src kinase) to which that ligand was known to bind. In several of these simulations, the ligand correctly identified its target binding site, forming a complex virtually identical to the crystallographically determined bound structure. The simulated trajectories provide a continuous, atomic-level view of the entire binding process, revealing persistent and noteworthy intermediate conformations and shedding light on the role of water molecules.
