  ABSTRACT = {Conifers have dominated forests for more than 200 million years and are of huge ecological and economic importance. Here we present the draft assembly of the 20-gigabase genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies), the first available for any gymnosperm. The number of well-supported genes (28,354) is similar to the {>}100 times smaller genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and there is no evidence of a recent whole-genome duplication in the gymnosperm lineage. Instead, the large genome size seems to result from the slow and steady accumulation of a diverse set of long-terminal repeat transposable elements, possibly owing to the lack of an efficient elimination mechanism. Comparative sequencing of Pinus sylvestris, Abies sibirica, Juniperus communis, Taxus baccata and Gnetum gnemon reveals that the transposable element diversity is shared among extant conifers. Expression of 24-nucleotide small RNAs, previously implicated in transposable element silencing, is tissue-specific and much lower than in other plants. We further identify numerous long ({>}10,000 base pairs) introns, gene-like fragments, uncharacterized long non-coding RNAs and short RNAs. This opens up new genomic avenues for conifer forestry and breeding.},

  ABSTRACT = {With ever-increasing amounts of data being produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments, the requirements placed on supporting e-infrastructures have grown. In this work, we provide recommendations based on the collective experiences from participants in the EU COST Action SeqAhead for the tasks of data preprocessing, upstream processing, data delivery, and downstream analysis, as well as long-term storage and archiving. We cover demands on computational and storage resources, networks, software stacks, automation of analysis, education, and also discuss emerging trends in the field. E-infrastructures for NGS require substantial effort to set up and maintain over time, and with sequencing technologies and best practices for data analysis evolving rapidly it is important to prioritize both processing capacity and e-infrastructure flexibility when making strategic decisions to support the data analysis demands of tomorrow. Due to increasingly demanding technical requirements we recommend that e-infrastructure development and maintenance be handled by a professional service unit, be it internal or external to the organization, and emphasis should be placed on collaboration between researchers and IT professionals.},

A consequence of this is that the medical discoveries of the future will largely depend on our ability to process and analyse large genomic data sets, which continue to expand as the cost of sequencing decreases. Herein, we provide an overview of cloud computing and big data technologies, and discuss how such expertise can be used to deal with biology's big data sets. In particular, big data technologies such as the Apache Hadoop project, which provides distributed and parallelised data processing and analysis of petabyte (PB) scale data sets will be discussed, together with an overview of the current usage of Hadoop within the bioinformatics community.},

@ARTICLE{Denk2004,
  ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional (3D) structural information on many length scales is of central importance in biological research. Excellent methods exist to obtain structures of molecules at atomic, organelles at electron microscopic, and tissue at light-microscopic resolution. A gap exists, however, when 3D tissue structure needs to be reconstructed over hundreds of micrometers with a resolution sufficient to follow the thinnest cellular processes and to identify small organelles such as synaptic vesicles. Such 3D data are, however, essential to understand cellular networks that, particularly in the nervous system, need to be completely reconstructed throughout a substantial spatial volume. Here we demonstrate that datasets meeting these requirements can be obtained by automated block-face imaging combined with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Backscattering contrast is used to visualize the heavy-metal staining of tissue prepared using techniques that are routine for transmission electron microscopy. Low-vacuum (20-60 Pa H(2)O) conditions prevent charging of the uncoated block face. The resolution is sufficient to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify synapses. Stacks of several hundred sections, 50-70 nm thick, have been obtained at a lateral position jitter of typically under 10 nm. This opens the possibility of automatically obtaining the electron-microscope-level 3D datasets needed to completely reconstruct the connectivity of neuronal circuits.},

Their main advantage is in explicitly treating structural flexibility and entropic effects. This allows a more accurate estimate of the thermodynamics and kinetics associated with drug–target recognition and binding, as better algorithms and hardware architectures increase their use. Here, we review the theoretical background of MD and enhanced sampling methods, focusing on free-energy perturbation, metadynamics, steered MD, and other methods most consistently used to study drug–target binding. We discuss unbiased MD simulations that nowadays allow the observation of unsupervised ligand–target binding, assessing how these approaches help optimizing target affinity and drug residence time toward improved drug efficacy. Further issues discussed include allosteric modulation and the role of water molecules in ligand binding and optimization. We conclude by calling for more prospective studies to ...},

Combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods are important in this field. By treating the reacting species with a quantum mechanical method (i.e., a method that calculates the electronic structure of the active site) and including the enzyme environment with simpler molecular mechanical methods, enzyme reactions can be modeled. Here, we review QM/MM methods and their application to enzyme-catalyzed reactions to investigate fundamental and practical problems in enzymology. A range of QM/MM methods is available, from cheaper and more approximate methods, which can be used for molecular dynamics simulations, to highly accurate electronic structure methods. We discuss how modeling of reactions using such methods can provide detailed insight into enzyme mechanisms and illustrate this by reviewing some recent applications...},

  ABSTRACT = {The kinetic rate constants of binding were estimated for four biochemically relevant molecular systems by a method that uses milestoning theory to combine Brownian dynamics simulations with more detailed molecular dynamics simulations. The rate constants found using this method agreed well with experimentally and theoretically obtained values. We predicted the association rate of a small charged molecule toward both a charged and an uncharged spherical receptor and verified the estimated value with Smoluchowski theory. We also calculated the kon rate constant for superoxide dismutase with its natural substrate, O2-, in a validation of a previous experiment using similar methods but with a number of important improvements. We also calculated the kon for a new system: the N-terminal domain of Troponin C with its natural substrate Ca2+. The kon calculated for the latter two systems closely resemble experimentally obtained values. This novel multiscale approach is computationally cheaper and more parallelizable when compared to other methods of similar accuracy. We anticipate that this methodology will be useful for predicting kinetic rate constants and for understanding the process of binding between a small molecule and a protein receptor.},

abstract = {This is a review. Non-electrolytic compounds typically cross cell membranes by passive diffusion. The rate of permeation is dependent on the chemical properties of the solute and the composition of the lipid bilayer membrane. Predicting the permeability coefficient of a solute is important in pharmaceutical chemistry and toxicology. Molecular simulation has proven to be a valuable tool for modeling permeation of solutes through a lipid bilayer. In particular, the solubility-diffusion model has allowed for the quantitative calculation of permeability coefficients. The underlying theory and computational methods used to calculate membrane permeability are reviewed. We also discuss applications of these methods to examine the permeability of solutes and the effect of membrane composition on permeability. The application of coarse grain and polarizable models is discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C. Gumbart and Sergei Noskov.},

  ABSTRACT = {A longstanding question in molecular biology is the extent to which the behavior of macromolecules observed in vitro accurately reflects their behavior in vivo. A number of sophisticated experimental techniques now allow the behavior of individual types of macromolecule to be studied directly in vivo; none, however, allow a wide range of molecule types to be observed simultaneously. In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and "snapshots" of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited "crowding" effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.},

A non-Markovian hopping mechanism is assumed and constructed from underlying microscopic dynamics. General analytical analysis, a pedagogical example, and numerical solutions of the non-Markovian model are presented. No assumption is made in the theoretical derivation on the type of microscopic dynamics along the reaction coordinate. However, the detailed calculations are for Brownian dynamics in which the velocities are uncorrelated in time (but spatial memory remains).},

  ABSTRACT = {Atomically detailed molecular dynamics trajectories in conjunction with Milestoning are used to analyse the different contributions of coarse variables to the permeation process of a small peptide (N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide, NATA) through a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membrane. The peptide reverses its overall orientation as it permeates through the biological bilayer. The large change in orientation is investigated explicitly but is shown to impact the free energy landscape and permeation time only moderately. Nevertheless, a significant difference in permeation properties of the two halves of the membrane suggests the presence of other hidden slow variables. We speculate, based on calculation of the potential of mean force, that a conformational transition of NATA makes significant contribution to these differences. Other candidates for hidden slow variables may include water permeation and collective motions of phospholipids.},

In case the reactant is in thermal equilibrium, the first passage times account well for the reaction dynamics as shown by comparison with exact numerical calculations. A simple integral expression for the rate constants is presented. For a case involving a reactant initially far off equilibrium, a two relaxation time description for the particle number N(t) is derived and compared with the results of an ’’exact’’ calculation. This description results from a knowledge of N(t = 0), Ṅ(t = 0), F∞ 0 d t  N(t), i.e., the first passage time, and F∞ 0 d t  t N(t).},

  ABSTRACT = {Here we extend the ability to predict hydrodynamic coefficients and other solution properties of rigid macromolecular structures from atomic-level structures, implemented in the computer program HYDROPRO, to models with lower, residue-level resolution. Whereas in the former case there is one bead per nonhydrogen atom, the latter contains one bead per amino acid (or nucleotide) residue, thus allowing calculations when atomic resolution is not available or coarse-grained models are preferred. We parameterized the effective hydrodynamic radius of the elements in the atomic- and residue-level models using a very large set of experimental data for translational and rotational coefficients (intrinsic viscosity and radius of gyration) for >50 proteins. We also extended the calculations to very large proteins and macromolecular complexes, such as the whole 70S ribosome. We show that with proper parameterization, the two levels of resolution yield similar and rather good agreement with experimental data. The new version of HYDROPRO, in addition to considering various computational and modeling schemes, is far more efficient computationally and can be handled with the use of a graphical interface.},

  ABSTRACT = {We have studied the diffusion of tracer proteins in highly concentrated random-coil polymer and globular protein solutions imitating the crowded conditions encountered in cellular environments. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent alpha characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, r(2)(t) approximately t(alpha). We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400 g/l is subdiffusive (alpha < 1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent alpha decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, alpha reaches a limit value of alpha(l) approximately 3/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.},

  ABSTRACT = {The crowded intracellular environment poses a formidable challenge to experimental and theoretical analyses of intracellular transport mechanisms. Our measurements of single-particle trajectories in cytoplasm and their random-walk interpretations elucidate two of these mechanisms: molecular diffusion in crowded environments and cytoskeletal transport along microtubules. We employed acousto-optic deflector microscopy to map out the three-dimensional trajectories of microspheres migrating in the cytosolic fraction of a cellular extract. Classical Brownian motion (BM), continuous time random walk, and fractional BM were alternatively used to represent these trajectories. The comparison of the experimental and numerical data demonstrates that cytoskeletal transport along microtubules and diffusion in the cytosolic fraction exhibit anomalous (nonFickian) behavior and posses statistically distinct signatures. Among the three random-walk models used, continuous time random walk provides the best representation of diffusion, whereas microtubular transport is accurately modeled with fractional BM.},

@ARTICLE{Setny2013,
  ABSTRACT = {Water plays a crucial part in virtually all protein-ligand binding processes in and out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate the role of water in the binding kinetics of a ligand to a prototypical hydrophobic pocket by explicit-water molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and implicit diffusional approaches. The concave pocket in the unbound state exhibits wet/dry hydration oscillations whose magnitude and time scale are significantly amplified by the approaching ligand. In turn, the ligand's stochastic motion intimately couples to the slow hydration fluctuations, leading to a sixfold-enhanced friction in the vicinity of the pocket entrance. The increased friction considerably decelerates association in the otherwise barrierless system, indicating the importance of molecular-scale hydrodynamic effects in cavity-ligand binding arising due to capillary fluctuations. We derive and analyze the diffusivity profile and show that the mean first passage time distribution from the MD simulation can be accurately reproduced by a standard Brownian dynamics simulation if the appropriate position-dependent friction profile is included. However, long-time decays in the water-ligand (random) force autocorrelation demonstrate violation of the Markovian assumption, challenging standard diffusive approaches for rate prediction. Remarkably, the static friction profile derived from the force correlations strongly resembles the profile derived on the Markovian assumption apart from a simple shift in space, which can be rationalized by a time-space retardation in the ligand's downhill dynamics toward the pocket. The observed spatiotemporal hydrodynamic coupling may be of biological importance providing the time needed for conformational receptor-ligand adjustments, typical of the induced-fit paradigm.},

Lead optimization programs that in their quest for efficacy focus solely on improving the affinity of drug-target binding are flawed, since this approach ignores the fluctuations in drug concentration that occur in vivo. Instead the lifetime of the drug-target complex must also be considered, since drugs only act when they are bound to their targets. Consequently, to improve the correlation between the in vitro and in vivo activity of drugs, measurements of drug-target residence time must be incorporated into the drug discovery process.},

While traditional in vitro methods view drug-target interactions exclusively in terms of equilibrium affinity, the residence time model takes into account the conformational dynamics of target macromolecules that affect drug binding and dissociation. The key tenet of this model is that the lifetime (or residence time) of the binary drug-target complex, and not the binding affinity per se, dictates much of the in vivo pharmacological activity. Here, this model is revisited and key applications of it over the past 10 years are highlighted.},

  ABSTRACT = {Anton is a recently completed special-purpose supercomputer designed for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biomolecular systems. The machine's specialized hardware dramatically increases the speed of MD calculations, making possible for the first time the simulation of biologicl molecules at an atomic level of detail for periods on the order of a millisecond--about two orders of magnitude beyond the previous state of the art. Anton is now running simulations on a timescale at which many critically important, but poorly understood phenomena are known to occur, allowing the observation of aspects of protein dynamics that were previously inaccessible to both computational and experimental study. Here, we report Anton's performance when executing actual MD simulations whose accuracy has been validated against both existing MD software and experimental observations. We also discuss the manner in which novel algorithms have been coordinated with Anton's co-designed, application-specific hardware to achieve these results.},

  ABSTRACT = {Anton 2 is a second-generation special-purpose supercomputer for molecular dynamics simulations that achieves significant gains in performance, programmability, and capacity compared to its predecessor, Anton 1. The architecture of Anton 2 is tailored for fine-grained event-driven operation, which improves performance by increasing the overlap of computation with communication, and also allows a wider range of algorithms to run efficiently, enabling many new software-based optimizations. A 512-node Anton 2 machine, currently in operation, is up to ten times faster than Anton 1 with the same number of nodes, greatly expanding the reach of all-atom bio molecular simulations. Anton 2 is the first platform to achieve simulation rates of multiple microseconds of physical time per day for systems with millions of atoms. Demonstrating strong scaling, the machine simulates a standard 23,558-atom benchmark system at a rate of 85 $\mu$s/day -- 180 times faster than any commodity hardware platform or general-purpose supercomputer.},

  ABSTRACT = {Although the thermodynamic principles that control the binding of drug molecules to their protein targets are well understood, detailed experimental characterization of the process by which such binding occurs has proven challenging. We conducted relatively long, unguided molecular dynamics simulations in which a ligand (the cancer drug dasatinib or the kinase inhibitor PP1) was initially placed at a random location within a box that also contained a protein (Src kinase) to which that ligand was known to bind. In several of these simulations, the ligand correctly identified its target binding site, forming a complex virtually identical to the crystallographically determined bound structure. The simulated trajectories provide a continuous, atomic-level view of the entire binding process, revealing persistent and noteworthy intermediate conformations and shedding light on the role of water molecules. The technique we employed, which does not assume any prior knowledge of the binding site's location, may pro...},

  ABSTRACT = {The mutation and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with the development of a variety of cancers, making this prototypical dimerization-activated receptor tyrosine kinase a prominent target of cancer drugs. Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the N lobe dimerization interface of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is intrinsically disordered and that it becomes ordered only upon dimerization. Our simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing activation without dimerization. We also find that phosphorylation of EGFR kinase domain at Tyr845 may suppress the intrinsic disorder, suggesting a molecular mechanism for autonomous EGFR signaling.},

  ABSTRACT = {How drugs bind to their receptors--from initial association, through drug entry into the binding pocket, to adoption of the final bound conformation, or "pose"--has remained unknown, even for G-protein-coupled receptor modulators, which constitute one-third of all marketed drugs. We captured this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses matching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the $\beta$(1)- and $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptors, initially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor's extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distance of 15 {Å} from the binding pocket, often presents the largest energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug-receptor binding and unbinding rates.},

The molecular determinants of drug-receptor binding kinetics remain poorly understood, however, especially when compared with the well-known factors that affect binding affinity. The rational modulation of kinetics during lead optimization thus remains challenging. We review some of the key factors thought to control drug-receptor binding kinetics at the molecular level - molecular size, conformational fluctuations, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effects - and discuss several possible approaches for the rational design of drugs with desired binding kinetics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding the fine balance between changes of entropy and enthalpy and the competition between a guest and water molecules in molecular binding is crucial in fundamental studies and practical applications. Experiments provide measurements. However, illustrating the binding/unbinding processes gives a complete picture of molecular recognition not directly available from experiments, and computational methods bridge the gaps. Here, we investigated guest association/dissociation with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) by using microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, post-analysis and numerical calculations. We computed association and dissociation rate constants, enthalpy, and solvent and solute entropy of binding. All the computed values of kon, koff, $\Delta$H, $\Delta$S, and $\Delta$G could be compared with experimental data directly and agreed reasonably with experiment findings. Water molecules play a crucial role in guest binding to beta-CD. Collective water/beta-CD motions could contribute to different computed kon and $\Delta$H values by using GAFF-CD and q4MD-CD force fields for beta-CD, mainly because of the motion of beta-CD that provides different hydrogen-bond networks of water molecules in the cavity of free beta-CD and the strength of desolvation penalty. Both force fields resulted in similar computed $\Delta$G from independently computed kinetics rates and thermodynamics properties ($\Delta$H, $\Delta$S) and suggest the same driving forces of binding, non-polar attractions between solutes and entropy gain of desolvating water molecules. However, the balances of $\Delta$H and -T$\Delta$S and enthalpy-entropy compensation are not identical. The study further interprets experiments, deepens our understanding of ligand binding, and suggests strategies for force field parameterization.},

  ABSTRACT = {The understanding of protein-ligand binding is of critical importance for biomedical research, yet the process itself has been very difficult to study because of its intrinsically dynamic character. Here, we have been able to quantitatively reconstruct the complete binding process of the enzyme-inhibitor complex trypsin-benzamidine by performing 495 molecular dynamics simulations of free ligand binding of 100 ns each, 187 of which produced binding events with an rmsd less than 2 Å compared to the crystal structure. The binding paths obtained are able to capture the kinetic pathway of the inhibitor diffusing from solvent (S0) to the bound (S4) state passing through two metastable intermediate states S2 and S3. Rather than directly entering the binding pocket the inhibitor appears to roll on the surface of the protein in its transition between S3 and the final binding pocket, whereas the transition between S2 and the bound pose requires rediffusion to S3. An estimation of the standard free energy of binding gives $\Delta$G° = -5.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mol (cf. the experimental value -6.2 kcal/mol), and a two-states kinetic model k(on) = (1.5 ± 0.2) × 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) and k(off) = (9.5 ± 3.3) × 10(4) s(-1) for unbound to bound transitions. The ability to reconstruct by simple diffusion the binding pathway of an enzyme-inhibitor binding process demonstrates the predictive power of unconventional high-throughput molecular simulations. Moreover, the methodology is directly applicable to other molecular systems and thus of general interest in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding the structural mechanisms of protein-ligand binding and their dependence on protein sequence and conformation is of fundamental importance for biomedical research. Here we investigate the interplay of conformational change and ligand-binding kinetics for the serine protease Trypsin and its competitive inhibitor Benzamidine with an extensive set of 150 $\mu$s molecular dynamics simulation data, analysed using a Markov state model. Seven metastable conformations with different binding pocket structures are found that interconvert at timescales of tens of microseconds. These conformations differ in their substrate-binding affinities and binding/dissociation rates. For each metastable state, corresponding solved structures of Trypsin mutants or similar serine proteases are contained in the protein data bank. Thus, our wild-type simulations explore a space of conformations that can be individually stabilized by adding ligands or making suitable changes in protein sequence. These findings provide direct evidence of conformational plasticity in receptors.},

Compared to long trajectories this method offers the possibility to start the simulations in successive batches, building a knowledgeable model of the available data to inform subsequent new simulations iteratively. Here, we demonstrate an automatic, iterative, on-the-fly method for learning and sampling molecular simulations in the context of ligand binding for the case of trypsin–benzamidine binding. The method uses Markov state models to learn a simplified model of the simulations and decide where best to sample from, achieving a converged binding affinity in approximately one microsecond, 1 order of magnitude faster than classical sampling. This method demonstrates for the first time the potential of adaptive sampling schemes in the case of ligand binding.},

Experimental approaches to binding and unbinding kinetics are nowadays available, but we still lack reliable computational tools for predicting kinetics and residence time. Most attempts have been based on brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are CPU-demanding and not yet particularly accurate. We recently reported a new scaled- MD-based protocol, which showed potential for residence time prediction in drug discovery. Here, we further challenged our procedure's predictive ability by applying our methodology to a series of glucokinase activators that could be useful for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. We combined scaled MD with experimental kinetics measurements and X-ray crystallography, promptly checking the protocol's reliability by directly comparing computational predictions and experimental measures.

For example, modeling of biological networks and cellular responses relies on the availability of information on rate coefficients. Atomically detailed simulations hold the promise of supplementing experimental data to obtain a more complete kinetic picture. However, simulations at biological time scales are challenging. Typical computer resources are insufficient to provide the ensemble of trajectories at the correct length that is required for straightforward calculations of time scales. In the last years, new technologies emerged that make atomically detailed simulations of rate coefficients possible. Instead of computing complete trajectories from reactants to products, these approaches launch a large number of short trajectories at different positions. Since the trajectories are short, they are computed trivially in parallel on modern computer architecture. The starting and termination positions of the short trajectories are chosen, following statistical mechanics theory, to enhance efficiency. These trajectories are analyzed. The analysis produces accurate estimates of time scales as long as hours. The theory of Milestoning that exploits the use of short trajectories is discussed, and several applications are described.},

  ABSTRACT = {Nearly every enzyme undergoes a significant change in structure after binding it's substrate. Experimental and theoretical analyses of the role of changes in HIV reverse transcriptase structure in selecting a correct substrate are presented. Atomically detailed simulations using the Milestoning method predict a rate and free energy profile of the conformational change commensurate with experimental data. A large conformational change occurring on a millisecond timescale locks the correct nucleotide at the active site but promotes release of a mismatched nucleotide. The positions along the reaction coordinate that decide the yield of the reaction are not determined by the chemical step. Rather, the initial steps of weak substrate binding and protein conformational transition significantly enrich the yield of a reaction with a correct substrate, whereas the same steps diminish the reaction probability of an incorrect substrate. {©} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {We use Markovian milestoning molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a tessellation of the collective variable space for CO localization in myoglobin to estimate the kinetics of entry, exit, and internal site-hopping. The tessellation is determined by analysis of the free-energy surface in that space using transition-path theory (TPT), which provides criteria for defining optimal milestones, allowing short, independent, cell-constrained MD simulations to provide properly weighted kinetic data. We coarse grain the resulting kinetic model at two levels: first, using crystallographically relevant internal cavities and their predicted interconnections and solvent portals; and second, as a three-state side-path scheme inspired by similar models developed from geminate recombination experiments. We show semiquantitative agreement with experiment on entry and exit rates and in the identification of the so-called "histidine gate" at position 64 through which ≈90{\%} of flux between solvent and the distal pocket passes. We also show with six-dimensional calculations that the minimum free-energy pathway of escape through the histidine gate is a "knock-on" mechanism in which motion of the ligand and the gate are sequential and interdependent. In total, these results suggest that such TPT simulations are indeed a promising approach to overcome the practical time-scale limitations of MD to allow reliable estimation of transition mechanisms and rates among metastable states.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ring-shaped, hexameric ATPase motors fulfill key functions in cellular processes, such as genome replication, transcription, or protein degradation, by translocating a long substrate through their central pore powered by ATP hydrolysis. Despite intense research efforts, the atomic-level mechanism transmitting chemical energy from hydrolysis into mechanical force that translocates the substrate is still unclear. Here we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with advanced path sampling techniques and milestoning analysis to characterize how mRNA substrate is translocated by an exemplary homohexameric motor, the transcription termination factor Rho. We find that the release of hydrolysis product (ADP + Pi) triggers the force-generating process of Rho through a 0.1 millisecond-long conformational transition, the time scale seen also in experiment. The calculated free energy profiles and kinetics show that Rho unidirectionally translocates the single-stranded RNA substrate via a population shift of the conformational states of Rho; upon hydrolysis product release, the most favorable conformation shifts from the pretranslocation state to the post-translocation state. Via two previously unidentified intermediate states, the RNA chain is seen to be pulled by six K326 side chains, whose motions are induced by highly coordinated relative translation and rotation of Rho's six subunits. The present study not only reveals in new detail the mechanism employed by ring-shaped ATPase motors, for example the use of loosely bound and tightly bound hydrolysis reactant and product states to coordinate motor action, but also provides an effective approach to identify allosteric sites of multimeric enzymes in general.},

  ABSTRACT = {The binding of ligands with their molecular receptors is of tremendous importance in biology. Although much emphasis has been placed on characterizing binding sites and bound poses that determine the binding thermodynamics, the pathway by which a ligand binds importantly determines the binding kinetics. The computational study of entire unbiased ligand binding and release pathways is still an emerging field, made possible only recently by advances in computational hardware and sampling methodologies. We have developed one such method (WExplore) that is based on a weighted ensemble of trajectories, which we apply to ligand release for the first time, using a set of three previously characterized interactions between low-affinity ligands and the protein FKBP-12 (FK-506 binding protein). WExplore is found to be more efficient that conventional sampling, even for the nanosecond-scale unbinding events observed here. From a nonequilibrium ensemble of unbinding trajectories, we obtain ligand residence times and ...},

  ABSTRACT = {We report simulations of full ligand exit pathways for the trypsin-benzamidine system, generated using the sampling technique WExplore. WExplore is able to observe millisecond-scale unbinding events using many nanosecond-scale trajectories that are run without introducing biasing forces. The algorithm generates rare events by dividing the coordinate space into regions, on-the-fly, and balancing computational effort between regions through cloning and merging steps, as in the weighted ensemble method. The averaged exit flux yields a ligand exit rate of 180 $\mu$s, which is within an order of magnitude of the experimental value. We obtain broad sampling of ligand exit pathways, and visualize our findings using conformation space networks. The analysis shows three distinct exit channels, two of which are formed through large, rare motions of the loop regions in trypsin. This broad set of ligand-bound poses is then used to investigate general properties of ligand binding: we observe both a direct stabilizing effect of ligand-protein interactions and an indirect destabilizing effect on intraprotein interactions that is induced by the ligand. Significantly, the crystallographic binding poses are distinguished not only because their ligands induce large stabilizing effects, but also because they induce relatively low indirect destabilizations.},

  ABSTRACT = {One of the unaddressed challenges in drug discovery is that drug potency determined in vitro is not a reliable indicator of drug activity in vivo. Accumulated evidence suggests that in vivo activity is more strongly correlated with the binding/unbinding kinetics than the equilibrium thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions (PLI). However, existing experimental and computational techniques are insufficient in studying the molecular details of kinetics process of PLI. Consequently, we not only have limited mechanistic understanding of the kinetic process but also lack a practical platform for the high-throughput screening and optimization of drug leads based on their kinetic properties. For the first time, we address this unmet need by integrating coarse-grained normal mode analysis with multi-target machine learning (MTML). To test our method, HIV-1 protease is used as a model system. We find that computational models based on the residue normal mode directionality displacement of PLI can not only recapitulate the results from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, but also predict protein-ligand binding/unbinding kinetics accurately. When combined with energetic features, the accuracy of combined kon and koff prediction reaches 74.35{\%}, and the accuracy for compound screening with in vivo drug activity has an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9435. Furthermore, our integrated model provides us with new insights into the molecular determinants of kinetics of PLI. We propose that the coherent coupling of conformational dynamics and thermodynamic interactions between receptor and ligand may play a critical role in determining the kinetic rate constants of PLI. In conclusion, we demonstrate that residue normal mode directionality displacement can serve as a kinetic fingerprint to capture long-time scale conformational dynamics of the binding/unbinding kinetics. Coupled with the MTML, it is possible to screen and optimize compounds based on their binding/unbinding kinetics in a high-throughput fashion. The further development of such computational tools will bridge one of the critical missing links between in vitro compound screening and in vivo drug activity.},

  ABSTRACT = {Drug-binding kinetics could play important roles in determining the efficacy of drugs and has caught the attention of more drug designers. Using the dissociation of 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]-pyridines from the focal adhesion kinase as an example, this work finds that steered molecular dynamics simulations could help screen compounds with long-residence times. It also reveals a two-step mechanism of ligand dissociation resembling the release of ADP from protein kinase A reported earlier. A phenyl group attaching to the pyrrole prolongs residence time by creating a large activation barrier for transition from the bound to the intermediate state when it becomes exposed to the solvent. Principal component analysis shows that ligand dissociation does not couple with large-scale collective motions of the protein involving many of its amino acids. Rather, a small subset of amino acids dominates. Some of these amino acids do not contact the ligands directly along the dissociation pathways and could exert long-range allosteric effects. {©} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Steered molecular dynamics simulations show that 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]-pyridines dissociate from the focal adhesion kinase through a two-step mechanism, revealed by the time course of different properties such as the solvent-accessible surface area of the compounds. A similar two-step mechanism was found before for the dissociation of ADP from protein kinase A. Many ATP-competitive inhibitors might dissociate from protein kinases through this same mechanism.},

  ABSTRACT = {We investigated the dissociation process of tri-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine from hen egg white lysozyme using parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD), which comprises cycles of multiple unbiased MD simulations using a selection of MD snapshots as the initial structures for the next cycle. Dissociation was significantly accelerated by PaCS-MD, in which the probability of rare event occurrence toward dissociation was enhanced by the selection and re-randomization of the initial velocities. Although this complex was stable during 1 $\mu$s of conventional MD, PaCS-MD easily induced dissociation within 100 – 101 ns. We found that velocity re-randomization enhances the dissociation of triNAG from the bound state, whereas diffusion plays a more important role in the unbound state. We calculated the dissociation free energy by analyzing all PaCS-MD trajectories using the Markov state model (MSM) and compared the results to those obtained by combinations of PaCS-MD and umbrella sampling (US), steered MD (SMD) and US, SMD and the Jarzynski equality, and experimentally determined binding free energy. PaCS-MD/MSM yielded results most comparable to the experimentally determined binding free energy, was independent of simulation parameter variations, and also gave the lowest standard errors.},

  ABSTRACT = {The generalized master equation or the equivalent continuous time random walk equations can be used to compute the macroscopic first passage time distribution (FPTD) of a complex stochastic system from short-term microscopic simulation data. The computation of the mean first passage time and additional low-order FPTD moments can be simplified by directly relating the FPTD moment generating function to the moments of the local FPTD matrix. This relationship can be physically interpreted in terms of steady-state relaxation, an extension of steady-state flow. Moreover, it is amenable to a statistical error analysis that can be used to significantly increase computational efficiency. The efficiency improvement can be extended to the FPTD itself by modelling it using a gamma distribution or rational function approximation to its Laplace transform.},

  ABSTRACT = {A recently introduced computational algorithm to extend time scales of atomically detailed simulations is illustrated. The algorithm, milestoning, is based on partitioning the dynamics to a sequence of trajectories between "milestones" and constructing a non-Markovian model for the motion along a reaction coordinate. The kinetics of a conformational transition in a blocked alanine is computed and shown to be accurate, more efficient than straightforward molecular dynamics by a factor of about 9, and nonexponential. A general scaling argument predicts a linear speedup with the number of milestones for diffusive processes and an exponential speedup for transitions over barriers. The algorithm is also trivial to parallelize. As a side result, milestoning also produces the free energy profile along the reaction coordinate and is able to describe nonequilibrium motions along one (or a few) degrees of freedom.},

  ABSTRACT = {A new milestoning procedure using Voronoi tessellations is proposed. In the new procedure, the edges of Voronoi cells are used as milestones, and the necessary kinetic information about the transitions between the milestones is calculated by running molecular dynamics ͑MD͒ simulations restricted to these cells. Like the traditional milestoning technique, the new procedure offers a reduced description of the original dynamics and permits to efficiently compute the various quantities necessary in this description. However, unlike traditional milestoning, the new procedure does not require to reinitialize trajectories from the milestones, and thereby it avoids the approximation made in traditional milestoning that the distribution for reinitialization is the equilibrium one. In this paper we concentrate on Markovian milestoning, which we show to be valid under suitable assumptions, and we explain how to estimate the rate matrix of transitions between the milestones from data collected from the MD trajectories in the Voronoi cells. The rate matrix can then be used to compute mean first passage times between milestones and reaction rates. The procedure is first illustrated on test-case examples in two dimensions and then applied to study the kinetics of protein insertion into a lipid bilayer by means of a coarse-grained model.},

Time dependent spectroscopy of the tryptophan side chain determines the rate of permeation into 150 nm phospholipid vesicles. Atomically detailed simulations are conducted to calculate the free energy profiles and the permeation coefficient. Different charging conditions of the peptide (positive, negative, or zwitterion) are considered. Both experiment and simulation reproduce the qualitative trend and suggest that the fastest permeation is when the tryptophan is positively charged. The permeation mechanism, which is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations, is of a translocation assisted by a local defect. The influence of long-range electrostatic interactions, such as the membrane dipole potential on the permeation process, is not significant.},

These include native, organo- and peptidic-linked cyclodextrins. q4md-CD features: (i) geometrical parameters from Amber99SB to describe the protein parts, (ii) geometrical parameters from GLYCAM04 for the carbohydrate and organic parts when available or those of Amber99SB otherwise, (iii) partial atomic charges, embedded in force field libraries for the carbohydrate and organic fragments, were derived using the R.E.D. tools according to the “Amber” strategy and (iv) scaling factors of 1.2 and 2.0 were imposed for the 1–4 electrostatic and 1–4 van der Waals interactions, respectively. Results given by q4md-CD on native cyclodextrins have been compared to those obtained with reference to force fields like GLYCAM04, GLYCAM06 and Amber99SB as well as with experimental data. This work not only gives a global view of the performances of the aforementioned force fields towards a correct description of solvated cyclodextrins, but also extends the capabilities of current force fields by addressing some issues concerning hydrogen bonding and opens new possibilities towards studies of glycoconjugates by molecular dynamics.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ultrasonic absorption method was applied to elucidate the dynamic properties of host-guest complexation between $\alpha$-cyclodextrin or $\beta$-cyclodextrin (host) and butanol isomers (guest) at 25°C. The aim of this work was to reveal the effect of a structural difference in the hydrophobic part of a guest on the kinetic parameters for an inclusion reaction with cyclodextrins. Moreover, it was expected to clarify the effect of the cavity size on the reaction. Only when the host and guest existed together in water, a clear single relaxational phenomenon was observed. The cause of the relaxation was responsible for the complexation reaction between the host and the guest. The rate and equilibrium constants were obtained from the concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency, and the standard volume changes of the complexation reaction were from the maximum absorption per wavelength. The backward rate constant, kb- was very dependent on the structure of the guest molecule. The kb value decreased in the next hydrophobic series, nor- {<} sec- {<} tert- in $\beta$-CD systems, although a smaller kb value was observed when the guest possessed a normal carbon chain in $\alpha$-CD systems. The results of the volume change of the reaction implied that $\alpha$-CD could only include a guest quite shallowly, and almost the entire guest molecule was included into the $\beta$-CD cavity.},

  ABSTRACT = {A single ultrasonic relaxational phenomenon was observed in aqueous solutions containing both beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) as host and nonionized or ionized acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) as guest. The observed relaxation was responsible for a dynamic complexation reaction between beta-CD and aspirin molecules, concomitant with a volume change during the reaction. The kinetic and equilibrium constants for the complexation in the acid (nonionized) form of the aspirin system were derived from the guest concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency. The equilibrium constant for the carboxylate (ionized) form of aspirin was determined from the concentration dependence of a maximum absorption per wavelength, and the rate constants were calculated by using the determined equilibrium constant and the observed relaxation frequencies, which remained nearly almost constant over the concentration range studied. The results showed that the effect of charge on the aspirin molecule was reflected only in the dissociation process from the beta-CD cavity, while no remarkable change was seen in the association process whose rate was diffusion controlled. The results could be explained on the basis of the difference of the hydrophobic moieties in the two guests that were included in the host cavity. The results of the standard volume change for the complexation reaction were closely related to the number of expelled water molecules originally located in the beta-CD cavity and the volume of the aspirin molecule incorporated into the beta-CD cavity.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ultrasonic absorption coefficients in the frequency range 0.8-95 MHz were measured in aqueous solution of undissociated and dissociated propionic acid in the presence of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) at 25 degreesC. A single relaxational absorption was found, although it was not observed in the absence of beta-CD. The cause of the relaxation was attributed to a perturbation of a chemical equilibrium associated with an interaction between propionic acid and beta-CD. The rate and thermodynamic constants for the association and dissociation reaction for the complex were determined from the concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency and the maximum absorption per wavelength. It was found that the complex formed by beta-CD and propionic acid is more stable when the acid is in undissociated form. Further, the ultrasonic relaxation associated with a proton-transfer reaction was also observed when no additive exists in the solution. The rate and thermodynamic parameters were also determined precisely. [References: 16]},

  ABSTRACT = {Ultrasonic absorption coefficients in the frequency range of 0.8-95 MHz were measured in aqueous solutions containing both beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) (host) and butanoic acid (in its dissociated form and undissociated one) (guest). A single relaxational phenomenon was observed only when the solutes were coexisting, although no relaxation was found in the beta-CD solution or in the acid solutions. The absorption was also measured in a solution of pentanoic acid (dissociated form) with beta-CD, and single relaxation was detected. The ultrasonic relaxation observed in these solutions was due to a perturbation of a chemical equilibrium related to a reaction of an inclusion complex formed by the host and guest. The equilibrium constant was obtained from the dependence of the maximum absorption per wavelength on the guest concentration. The rate constant for the inclusion process of the guest into a cavity of beta-CD and that for the leaving process from the cavity were determined from the obtained relaxation frequency and the equilibrium constant. The standard volume change of the reaction was also computed from the maximum absorption per wavelength. These results were compared with those in solutions containing both beta-CD and different guest molecules. It was found that the hydrophobicity of guest molecules played an important role in the formation of the inclusion complex and also that the charge on the carboxylic group had a considerable effect on the kinetic characteristics of the complexation reaction.},

  ABSTRACT = {The complexation behavior of 1-naphthyl-1-ethanol (1-NpOH) and 2-naphthyl-1-ethanol (2-NpOH) with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was studied by employing several spectroscopic techniques. In the case of 1-NpOH, only a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry is formed with beta-CD, which. has an equilibrium constant that is smaller than that observed for the 1:1 complex between beta-CD and 2-NpOH. Excimer emission was observed in the presence of beta-CD for solutions containing high 2-NpOH concentrations. This excimer emission was ascribed to a complex with 2:2 beta-CD/2-NpOH stoichiometry. In addition, H-1 NMR data suggest that 2-NpOH is axially incorporated into the beta-CD cavity. Only in the case of 2-NpOH was a broadening of the signals corresponding to the aromatic protons observed in the presence of beta-CD. This broadening was attributed to the formation of the 2:2 complex. The dynamics of NpOH complexation was investigated by using the quenching methodology for triplet states. The entry rate constants for the 1:1 complex of 1-NpOH and 2-NpOH are (4.7 +/- 1.9) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) and (2.9 +/- 1.6) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively, whereas the exit rate constants for the two compounds are (4.8 +/- 1.8) x 10(5) s(-1) and (1.8 +/- 0.7) x 10(5) s(-1). In the case of 2-NpOH, we were able for the first time to estimate the rate constant for the dissociation of a beta-CD 2:2 complex ((0.2-2.5) x 10(3) s(-1)), showing that the dynamics for complexes including more than one cyclodextrin are remarkably slower than the dynamics observed for 1:1 complexes.},

  ABSTRACT = {Classical Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for liquid water in the NPT ensemble at 25 °C and 1 atm using six of the simpler intermolecular potential functions for the water dimer: Bernal–Fowler (BF), SPC, ST2, TIPS2, TIP3P, and TIP4P. Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18{\%} overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

Foremost among the models used to elucidate the electrostatic potential is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; however, existing methods for solving this equation have limited the scope of accurate electrostatic calculations to relatively small biomolecular systems. Here we present the application of numerical methods to enable the trivially parallel solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for supramolecular structures that are orders of magnitude larger in size. As a demonstration of this methodology, electrostatic potentials have been calculated for large microtubule and ribosome structures. The results point to the likely role of electrostatics in a variety of activities of these structures.},

  ABSTRACT = {The benefit of using positive allosteric modulators of protein function in the therapy of human diseases is becoming more apparent. The advantage of positive allosteric modulators is that they can possess specificity and selectivity profiles as well as concentration-independent limits on activity that can significantly reduce off-target effects in vivo. However, many current screening paradigms are not designed to discover positive allosteric modulators, and modulators that are discovered serendipitously can be overlooked during the hit-picking process. The conditions needed to discover positive allosteric modulators in a HTS are reasonable and simple to implement, generally requiring consideration of the ligand concentration in a screen. Other considerations in the screening for positive allosteric modulators can be derived from the analysis of simple kinetic schemes that describe the interactions of ligands and modulators with different protein targets.},

Because of their ability to modulate receptor conformations in the presence of orthosteric ligand, allosteric modulators can "fine-tune" classical pharmacological responses. This is advantageous in terms of a potential for engendering greater GPCR subtype-selectivity, but represents a significant challenge for detecting and validating allosteric behaviors. Although allosteric sites need not have evolved to accommodate endogenous ligands, there are a number of examples of where such modulators have been shown to contribute to physiological or pathophysiological processes. Studies are also beginning to unravel the structural basis of allosteric modulation of GPCRs. It remains to be determined whether such modulation represents interactions within monomers versus across dimers.},

  ABSTRACT = {Historically, traditional screening for ligands has been optimized to detect standard orthosteric agonists and antagonists. However, with increasing emphasis on cellular functional screens, more allosteric ligands are being discovered as potential drugs. In addition, there are theoretical reasons (increased selectivity, better control of physiological systems, separate control of affinity and efficacy) allosteric ligands may be preferred therapeutic chemical targets. These factors may make it desirable to design high-throughput screens to specifically detect functionally allosteric ligands. This article discusses the unique features of allosteric ligands as drugs as well as the special conditions that should be considered to optimize a high-throughput screen toward the detection of allosteric drugs. Finally, the likelihood of detecting allosteric ligands that have direct effects on cells (either conventional agonism or functionally selective effects) is discussed as well as the optimization of detection of such ligands in screening assays.},

  ABSTRACT = {Currently, there are two types of drugs on the market: orthosteric, which bind at the active site; and allosteric, which bind elsewhere on the protein surface, and allosterically change the conformation of the protein binding site. In this perspective we argue that the different mechanisms through which the two drug types affect protein activity and their potential pitfalls call for different considerations in drug design. The key problem facing orthosteric drugs is side effects which can occur by drug binding to homologous proteins sharing a similar binding site. Hence, orthosteric drugs should have very high affinity to the target; this would allow a low dosage to selectively achieve the goal of target-only binding. By contrast, allosteric drugs work by shifting the free energy landscape. Their binding to the protein surface perturbs the protein surface atoms, and the perturbation propagates like waves, finally reaching the binding site. Effective drugs should have atoms in good contact with the 'right' protein atoms; that is, the contacts should elicit propagation waves optimally reaching the protein binding site target. While affinity is important, the design should consider the protein conformational ensemble and the preferred propagation states. We provide examples from functional in vivo scenarios for both types of cases, and suggest how high potency can be achieved in allosteric drug development.},

Here, we overview the current knowledge on allosteric signal transmission from the network point of view, and show that most intra-protein conformational changes may be dynamically transmitted across protein-protein interaction and signaling networks of the cell. Allo-network drugs influence the pharmacological target protein indirectly using specific inter-protein network pathways. We show that allo-network drugs may have a higher efficiency to change the networks of human cells than those of other organisms, and can be designed to have specific effects on cells in a diseased state. Finally, we summarize possible methods to identify allo-network drug targets and sites, which may develop to a promising new area of systems-based drug design.},

However, orthosteric site configuration is similar in several proteins performing related functions and this leads to a lower specificity of a drug for the desired protein. Consequently, such drugs may have adverse side effects. A new basis of drug discovery is emerging based on the binding of the drug molecules to sites away (allosteric) from the orthosteric sites. It is possible to find allosteric sites which are unique and hence more specific as targets for drug discovery. Of many available examples, two are highlighted here. The first is caloxins - a new class of highly specific inhibitors of plasma membrane Ca²⁺ pumps. The second concerns the modulation of receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which binds to 12 types of receptors. Exploitation of allosteric sites has led to the discovery of drugs which can selectively modulate the activation of only 1 (M1 muscarinic) out of the 12 different types of acetylcholine receptors. These drugs are being tested for schizophrenia treatment. It is anticipated that the drug discovery exploiting allosteric sites will lead to more effective therapeutic agents with fewer side effects.},

  ABSTRACT = {Drug designing targeting protein-protein interactions is challenging. Because structural elucidation and computational analysis have revealed the importance of hot spot residues in stabilizing these interactions, there have been on-going efforts to develop drugs which bind the hot spots and out-compete the native protein partners. The question arises as to what are the key 'druggable' properties of hot spots in protein-protein interactions and whether these mimic the general hot spot definition. Identification of orthosteric (at the protein- protein interaction site) and allosteric (elsewhere) druggable hot spots is expected to help in discovering compounds that can more effectively modulate protein-protein interactions. For example, are there any other significant features beyond their location in pockets in the interface? The interactions of protein-protein hot spots are coupled with conformational dynamics of protein complexes. Currently increasing efforts focus on the allosteric drug discovery. Allosteric drugs bind away from the native binding site and can modulate the native interactions. We propose that identification of allosteric hot spots could similarly help in more effective allosteric drug discovery. While detection of allosteric hot spots is challenging, targeting drugs to these residues has the potential of greatly increasing the hot spot and protein druggability.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allostery involves coupling of conformational changes between two widely separated binding sites. The common view holds that allosteric proteins are symmetric oligomers, with each subunit existing in "at least" two conformational states with a different affinity for ligands. Recent observations such as the allosteric behavior of myoglobin, a classical example of a nonallosteric protein, call into question the existing allosteric dogma. Here we argue that all (nonfibrous) proteins are potentially allosteric. Allostery is a consequence of re-distributions of protein conformational ensembles. In a nonallosteric protein, the binding site shape may not show a concerted second-site change and enzyme kinetics may not reflect an allosteric transition. Nevertheless, appropriate ligands, point mutations, or external conditions may facilitate a population shift, leading a presumably nonallosteric protein to behave allosterically. In principle, practically any potential drug binding to the protein surface can alter the conformational redistribution. The question is its effectiveness in the redistribution of the ensemble, affecting the protein binding sites and its function. Here, we review experimental observations validating this view of protein allostery.},

  ABSTRACT = {The presence of druggable, topographically distinct allosteric sites on a wide range of receptor families has offered new paradigms for small molecules to modulate receptor function. Moreover, ligands that target allosteric sites offer significant advantages over the corresponding orthosteric ligands in terms of selectivity, including subtype selectivity within receptor families, and can also impart improved physicochemical properties. However, allosteric ligands are not a panacea. Many chemical issues (e.g., flat structure-activity relationships) and pharmacological issues (e.g., ligand-biased signaling) that are allosteric centric have emerged. Notably, the fact that allosteric sites are less evolutionarily conserved leads to improved selectivity; however, this can also lead to species differences that can hinder safety assessment. Many allosteric ligands possess molecular switches, wherein a small structural change (chemical or metabolic) can modulate the mode of pharmacology or receptor subtype selectivity. As the field has matured, as described here, key principles and strategies have emerged for the design of ligands/drugs for allosteric sites.},

  ABSTRACT = {The value of using negative allosteric modulators of protein function in therapeutic treatment of human diseases is becoming more apparent. Many current screening paradigms, however, are not consciously designed to discover negative allosteric modulators, and those that are serendipitously discovered can be easily overlooked during the hit-picking process. The conditions necessary for the discovery of negative allosteric modulators in a high-throughput screen are quite reasonable and simple to implement, generally requiring a consideration of the ligand concentration in a screen. Other considerations in the screening for negative allosteric modulators can be derived from an analysis of simple kinetic schemes that describe the interactions of ligands and modulators with different protein targets.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allosteric drugs bind to sites which are usually less conserved evolutionarily as compared to orthosteric sites. As such, they can discriminate between closely related proteins, have fewer side effects, and a consequent lower concentration can convey a lesser likelihood of receptor desensitization. However, an allosteric mode of action may also make the results of preclinical and animal experiments less predictive. The sensitivity of the allosteric consequences to the environment further increases the importance of accounting for patient population diversity. Even subtle differences in protein sequence, in cellular metabolic states or in target tissues, can result in different outcomes. This mini-hot-topic issue of CTMC showcases some successes and challenges of allosteric drug development through the examples of seventransmembrane (GPCR), AMPA, NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors, as well as the morpheein model of allosterism involved in inherent metabolic errors. Finally, the development of allo-network drugs, which are allosteric drugs acting indirectly on the neighborhood of the pharmacological target in protein-protein interaction or signaling networks, is described.},

  ABSTRACT = {High-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries is used to discover novel leads for drug development. When a structure is available for the target, computer-based screening using molecular docking may also be considered. The two techniques have rarely been used together on the same target. The opportunity to do so presented itself in a project to discover novel inhibitors for the enzyme protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B), a tyrosine phosphatase that has been implicated as a key target for type II diabetes. A corporate library of approximately 400?000 compounds was screened using high-throughput experimental techniques for compounds that inhibited PTP1B. Concurrently, molecular docking was used to screen approximately 235?000 commercially available compounds against the X-ray crystallographic structure of PTP1B, and 365 high-scoring molecules were tested as inhibitors of the enzyme. Of approximately 400?000 molecules tested in the high-throughput experimental assay, 85 (0.021{\%}) inhibited the enzyme with IC50 values less than 100 ?M; the most active had an IC50 value of 4.2 ?M. Of the 365 molecules suggested by molecular docking, 127 (34.8{\%}) inhibited PTP1B with IC50 values less than 100 ?M; the most active of these had an IC50 of 1.7 ?M. Structure-based docking therefore enriched the hit rate by 1700-fold over random screening. The hits from both the high-throughput and docking screens were dissimilar from phosphotyrosine, the canonical substrate group for PTP1B; the two hit lists were also very different from each other. Surprisingly, the docking hits were judged to be more druglike than the HTS hits. The diversity of both hit lists and their dissimilarity from each other suggest that docking and HTS may be complementary techniques for lead discovery.

  ABSTRACT = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest class of drug targets, accounting for more than 40{\%} of marketed drugs; however, discovery efforts for many GPCRs have failed to provide viable drug candidates. Historically, drug discovery efforts have focused on developing ligands that act at the orthosteric site of the endogenous agonist. Recently, efforts have focused on functional assay paradigms and the discovery of ligands that act at allosteric sites to modulate receptor function in either a positive, negative, or neutral manner. Allosteric modulators have numerous advantages over orthosteric ligands, including high subtype selectivity; the ability to mimic physiological conditions; the lack of densensitization, downregulation, and internalization; and reduced side effects. Despite these virtues, challenging issues have now arisen for allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs): shallow SAR, ligand-directed trafficking, and the identification of subtle "molecular switches" that modulate the modes of pharmacology. Here, we will discuss the impact of modest structural changes to multiple mGluR allosteric ligands scaffolds that unexpectedly modulate pharmacology and raise concerns over metabolism and the pharmacology of metabolites.},

  ABSTRACT = {This review presents the current data on the efficacy and safety of the selective mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib in patients with metastatic BRAF V600-positive melanoma. The pharmacological, safety, and efficacy data come from the Phase I, II, and III studies of trametinib monotherapy, as well as those in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. The most common adverse effects of trametinib therapy are rash, dermatitis, diarrhea, and fatigue. The Phase III METRIC study showed significant improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival in favor of trametinib over standard dacarbazine or paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, trametinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a single agent for the treatment of patients with V600E-mutated metastatic melanoma. Progression-free survival and response rates for trametinib monotherapy were lower than those noted with BRAF inhibitors. The second step in developing trametinib was to use the combination of trametinib with the BRAF inhibitor, eg, dabrafenib, to postpone the progression on MEK or BRAF inhibitors. The recently published data showed significant improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival in favor of the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib over vemurafenib therapy or dabrafenib alone, with good tolerance. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the combination of dabrafenib (150 mg orally twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma, and their use seems to be currently the best approach. While BRAF-MEK inhibition is a standard, molecular targeted therapy in BRAF-mutated melanomas, its future utility has to be established in the rapidly changing landscape of immunotherapeutics.},

  ABSTRACT = {N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors belong to the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which mediate most excitatory synaptic transmission in mammalian brains. Calcium permeation triggered by activation of NMDA receptors is the pivotal event for initiation of neuronal plasticity. Here, we show the crystal structure of the intact heterotetrameric GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor ion channel at 4 angstroms. The NMDA receptors are arranged as a dimer of GluN1-GluN2B heterodimers with the twofold symmetry axis running through the entire molecule composed of an amino terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), and a transmembrane domain (TMD). The ATD and LBD are much more highly packed in the NMDA receptors than non-NMDA receptors, which may explain why ATD regulates ion channel activity in NMDA receptors but not in non-NMDA receptors.},

  ABSTRACT = {A general model is presented whereby ligand-induced changes in protein dynamics could produce allosteric communication between distinct binding sites, even in the absence of a macromolecular conformational change. Theoretical analysis, based on the statistical thermodynamics of ligand binding, shows that cooperative interaction free energies amounting to several kJ . mol-1 may be generated by this means. The effect arises out of the possible changes in frequencies and amplitudes of macromolecular thermal fluctuations in response to ligand attachment, and can involve all forms of dynamic behaviour, ranging from highly correlated, low-frequency normal mode vibrations to random local anharmonic motions of individual atoms or groups. Dynamic allostery of this form is primarily an entropy effect, and we derive approximate expressions which might allow the magnitude of the interaction in real systems to be calculated directly from experimental observations such as changes in normal mode frequencies and mean-square atomic displacements. Long-range influence of kinetic processes at different sites might also be mediated by a similar mechanism. We suggest that proteins and other biological macromolecules may have evolved to take functional advantage not only of mean conformational states but also of the inevitable thermal fluctuations about the mean.},

  ABSTRACT = {(First section of introduction) Understanding a protein as a molecular mechanism - which it is - requires detailed and accurate knowledge of its structure and dynamics. Our knowledge of protein structure is by now very extensive and growing almost exponentially. Over 1000 structures modeled at atomic resolution I have been determined by X-ray diffraction and to a lesser extent by high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our knowledge of protein dynamicsis by comparison still rather fragmentary. To a large extent this is due to the fact that the most powerful method for structure determination - X-ray diffraction - provides no direct information on motion, as B-factors and missing electron density do not distinguish between static and dynamic disorder. Even for a protein undergoing a structural transition, it presents a fait accompli - the detailed structures of the initial and final states. The same type of information can be derived from structural studies by NMR, which almost always assume that the structure is rigid.},

  ABSTRACT = {Whereas previously we have successfully utilized the folding funnels concept to rationalize binding mechanisms (Ma B, Kumar S, Tsai CJ, Nussinov R, 1999, Protein Eng 12:713-720) and to describe binding (Tsai CJ, Kumar S, Ma B, Nussinov R, 1999, Protein Sci 8:1181-1190), here we further extend the concept of folding funnels, illustrating its utility in explaining enzyme pathways, multimolecular associations, and allostery. This extension is based on the recognition that funnels are not stationary; rather, they are dynamic, depending on the physical or binding conditions (Tsai CJ, Ma B, Nussinov R, 1999, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96:9970-9972). Different binding states change the surrounding environment of proteins. The changed environment is in turn expressed in shifted energy landscapes, with different shapes and distributions of populations of conformers. Hence, the function of a protein and its properties are not only decided by the static folded three-dimensional structure; they are determined by the distribution of its conformational substates, and in particular, by the redistributions of the populations under different environments. That is, protein function derives from its dynamic energy landscape, caused by changes in its surroundings.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allostery is essential for controlled catalysis, signal transmission, receptor trafficking, turning genes on and off, and apoptosis. It governs the organism's response to environmental and metabolic cues, dictating transient partner interactions in the cellular network. Textbooks taught us that allostery is a change of shape at one site on the protein surface brought about by ligand binding to another. For several years, it has been broadly accepted that the change of shape is not induced; rather, it is observed simply because a larger protein population presents it. Current data indicate that while side chains can reorient and rewire, allostery may not even involve a change of (backbone) shape. Assuming that the enthalpy change does not reverse the free-energy change due to the change in entropy, entropy is mainly responsible for binding.},

  ABSTRACT = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {Proteins can exist in a large number of conformations around their native states that can be characterized by an energy landscape. The landscape illustrates individual valleys, which are the conformational substates. From the functional standpoint, there are two key points: first, all functionally relevant substates pre-exist; and second, the landscape is dynamic and the relative populations of the substates will change following allosteric events. Allosteric events perturb the structure, and the energetic strain propagates and shifts the population. This can lead to changes in the shapes and properties of target binding sites. Here we present an overview of dynamic conformational ensembles focusing on allosteric events in signaling. We propose that combining equilibrium fluctuation concepts with genomic screens could help drug discovery. ?? Elsevier Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {In receptor-ligand binding, a question that generated considerable interest is whether the mechanism is induced fit or conformational selection. This question is addressed here by a solvable model, in which a receptor undergoes transitions between active and inactive forms. The inactive form is favored while unbound but the active form is favored while a ligand is loosely bound. As the active-inactive transition rates increase, the binding mechanism gradually shifts from conformational selection to induced fit. The timescale of conformational transitions thus plays a crucial role in controlling binding mechanisms.},

  ABSTRACT = {The fact that we observe a single conformational selection event during binding does not necessarily mean that only a single conformational selection event takes place, even though this is the common assumption. Here we suggest that conformational selection takes place not once in a given binding/allosteric event, but at every step along the allosteric pathway. This view generalizes conformational selection and makes it applicable also to other allosteric events, such as post-translational modifications (PTMs) and photon absorption. Similar to binding, at each step along a propagation pathway, conformational selection is coupled with induced fit which optimizes the interactions. Thus, as in binding, the allosteric effects induced by PTMs and light relate not only to population shift; but to conformational selection as well. Conformational selection and population shift take place conjointly. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to shed light on the long debate over whether conformational selection (CS) or induced fit (IF) is the governing mechanism for protein-ligand binding. The main difference between the two scenarios is whether the conformational transition of the protein from the unbound form to the bound form occurs before or after encountering the ligand. Here we introduce the IF fraction (i.e., the fraction of binding events achieved via IF), to quantify the binding mechanism. Using simulations of a model protein-ligand system, we demonstrate that both the rate of the conformational transition and the concentration of ligand molecules can affect the IF fraction. CS dominates at slow conformational transition and low ligand concentration. An increase in either quantity results in a higher IF fraction. Despite the many-body nature of the system and the involvement of multiple, disparate types of dynamics (i.e., ligand diffusion, protein conformational transition, and binding reaction), the overall binding kinetics over wide ranges of parameters can be fit to a single exponential, with the apparent rate constant exhibiting a linear dependence on ligand concentration. The present study may guide future kinetics experiments and dynamics simulations in determining the IF fraction.},

Here, based on extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we present an atomistic picture of the pathways mediating the allosteric regulation of the PPIase domain of Pin1 by its WW domain. Two pathways jointly propagate the action of substrate-WW binding to produce closure and rigidification of three PPIase catalytic-site loops. One pathway preexists in the apo protein, but remains dormant until substrate-WW binding completes the second. The reduction in conformational entropy and preorganization of the catalytic-site loops observed here may explain why substrate-WW binding enhances ligand affinity and catalytic activity of the PPIase domain and suggest a combination drug therapy for Pin1-related diseases. Whereas the traditional view of allostery has emphasized conformational transition, our study identifies a distinct role of conformational dynamics in eliciting allostery.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allostery has come of age; the number, breadth and functional roles of documented protein allostery cases are rising quickly. Since all dynamic proteins are potentially allosteric and allostery plays crucial roles in all cellular pathways, sorting and classifying allosteric mechanisms in proteins should be extremely useful in understanding and predicting how the signals are regulated and transmitted through the dynamic multi-molecular cellular organizations. Classification organizes the complex information thereby unraveling relationships and patterns in molecular activation and repression. In signaling, current classification schemes consider classes of molecules according to their functions; for example, epinephrine and norepinephrine secreted by the central nervous system are classified as neurotransmitters. Other schemes would account for epinephrine when secreted by the adrenal medulla to be hormone-like. Yet, such classifications account for the global function of the molecule; not for the molecular mechanism of how the signal transmission initiates and how it is transmitted. Here we provide a unified view of allostery and the first classification framework. We expect that a classification scheme would assist in comprehension of allosteric mechanisms, in prediction of signaling on the molecular level, in better comprehension of pathways and regulation of the complex signals, in translating them to the cascading events, and in allosteric drug design. We further provide a range of examples illustrating mechanisms in protein allostery and their classification from the cellular functional standpoint.},

Previously detected hydrophobic spines serve as connectors between communities. Communities do not follow the traditional subdomain structure of the kinase core or its secondary structure elements. Instead they are organized around main functional units. Integration of the communities depends on the assembly of the hydrophobic spine and phosphorylation of the activation loop. Single mutations can significantly disrupt the dynamic infrastructure and thereby interfere with long-distance allosteric signaling that propagates throughout the whole molecule. Dynamics is proposed to be the underlying mechanism for allosteric regulation in protein kinases.},

  ABSTRACT = {Most proteins consist of multiple domains. How do linkers efficiently transfer information between sites that are on different domains to activate the protein? Mere flexibility only implies that the conformations would be sampled. For fast timescales between triggering events and cellular response, which often involves large conformational change, flexibility on its own may not constitute a good solution. We posit that successive conformational states along major allosteric propagation pathways are pre-encoded in linker sequences where each state is encoded by the previous one. The barriers between these states that are hierarchically populated are lower, achieving faster timescales even for large conformational changes. We further propose that evolution has optimized the linker sequences and lengths for efficiency, which explains why mutations in linkers may affect protein function and review the literature in this light.},

  ABSTRACT = {Here, we represent protein structures as residue interacting networks, which are assumed to involve a permanent flow of information between amino acids. By removal of nodes from the protein network, we identify fold centrally conserved residues, which are crucial for sustaining the shortest pathways and thus play key roles in long-range interactions. Analysis of seven protein families (myoglobins, G-protein-coupled receptors, the trypsin class of serine proteases, hemoglobins, oligosaccharide phosphorylases, nuclear receptor ligand-binding domains and retroviral proteases) confirms that experimentally many of these residues are important for allosteric communication. The agreement between the centrally conserved residues, which are key in preserving short path lengths, and residues experimentally suggested to mediate signaling further illustrates that topology plays an important role in network communication. Protein folds have evolved under constraints imposed by function. To maintain function, protein structures need to be robust to mutational events. On the other hand, robustness is accompanied by an extreme sensitivity at some crucial sites. Thus, here we propose that centrally conserved residues, whose removal increases the characteristic path length in protein networks, may relate to the system fragility.},

  ABSTRACT = {Although allostery draws increasing attention, not much is known about allosteric mechanisms. Here we argue that in all proteins, allosteric signals transmit through multiple, pre-existing pathways; which pathways dominate depend on protein topologies, specific binding events, covalent modifications, and cellular (environmental) conditions. Further, perturbation events at any site on the protein surface (or in the interior) will not create new pathways but only shift the pre-existing ensemble of pathways. Drugs binding at different sites or??mutational events in disease shift the ensemble toward the same conformations; however, the relative populations of the different states will change. Consequently the observed functional, conformational, and dynamic effects will be different. This is the origin of allosteric functional modulation in dynamic proteins: allostery does not necessarily need to invoke conformational rearrangements to control protein activity and pre-existing pathways are always defaulted to during allostery regardless of the stimulant and perturbation site in the protein. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  ABSTRACT = {For mapping energetic interactions in proteins, a technique was developed that uses evolutionary data for a protein family to measure statistical interactions between amino acid positions. For the PDZ domain family, this analysis predicted a set of energetically coupled positions for a binding site residue that includes unexpected long-range interactions. Mutational studies confirm these predictions, demonstrating that the statistical energy function is a good indicator of thermodynamic coupling in proteins. Sets of interacting residues form connected pathways through the protein fold that may be the basis for efficient energy conduction within proteins.},

  ABSTRACT = {A fundamental goal in cellular signaling is to understand allosteric communication, the process by which signals originating at one site in a protein propagate reliably to affect distant functional sites. The general principles of protein structure that underlie this process remain unknown. Here, we describe a sequence-based statistical method for quantitatively mapping the global network of amino acid interactions in a protein. Application of this method for three structurally and functionally distinct protein families (G protein-coupled receptors, the chymotrypsin class of serine proteases and hemoglobins) reveals a surprisingly simple architecture for amino acid interactions in each protein family: a small subset of residues forms physically connected networks that link distant functional sites in the tertiary structure. Although small in number, residues comprising the network show excellent correlation with the large body of mechanistic data available for each family. The data suggest that evolutionarily conserved sparse networks of amino acid interactions represent structural motifs for allosteric communication in proteins.},

  ABSTRACT = {Human fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is an allosteric enzyme that is regulated by different ligands. There are only two known isozymes in human tissues: the liver isozyme (the key enzyme of gluconeogenesis), which is regulated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and its muscle counterpart (participating in glycogen synthesis), which is regulated by calcium ions. AMP, which is an allosteric inhibitor of both isozymes, inhibits the muscle isozyme with an I(0.5) that is 35-100 times lower than for the liver isozyme and the reason for this difference remains obscure. In studies aiming at an explanation of the main differences in the regulation of the two isozymes, it has been shown that only one residue, in position 69, regulates the sensitivity towards calcium ions. As a consequence of this finding, an E69Q mutant of the muscle isozyme, which is insensitive to calcium ions while retaining all other kinetic properties resembling the liver isozyme, has been prepared and crystallized. Here, two crystal structures of this mutant enzyme in complex with AMP with and without fructose 6-phosphate (the product of the catalytic reaction) are presented. The AMP binding pattern of the muscle isozyme is quite similar to that of the liver isozyme and the T conformations of the two isozymes are nearly the same.},

Allosteric signal propagation does not stop at the 'end' of a protein, but may be dynamically transmitted across the cell. We propose here that the concept of allosteric drugs can be broadened to 'allo-network drugs' - whose effects can propagate either within a protein, or across several proteins, to enhance or inhibit specific interactions along a pathway. We posit that current allosteric drugs are a special case of allo-network drugs, and suggest that allo-network drugs can achieve specific, limited changes at the systems level, and in this way can achieve fewer side effects and lower toxicity. Finally, we propose steps and methods to identify allo-network drug targets and sites that outline a new paradigm in systems-based drug design. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All Rights Reserved.},

Here we present the X-ray structures of human MEK1 and MEK2, each determined as a ternary complex with MgATP and an inhibitor to a resolution of 2.4 A and 3.2 A, respectively. The structures reveal that MEK1 and MEK2 each have a unique inhibitor-binding pocket adjacent to the MgATP-binding site. The presence of the potent inhibitor induces several conformational changes in the unphosphorylated MEK1 and MEK2 enzymes that lock them into a closed but catalytically inactive species.

  ABSTRACT = {| Aberrant activation of the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK1/2 pathway occurs in more than 30{\%} of human cancers. As part of this pathway, MEK1 and MEK2 have crucial roles in tumorigenesis, cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis and, therefore, MEK1/2 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic strategy in a number of cancers. Highly selective and potent non-ATP-competitive allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitors have been developed and assessed in numerous clinical studies over the past decade. These agents are not efficacious in a broad range of unselected cancers, although single-agent antitumour activity has been detected mainly in tumours that harbour mutations in genes encoding the members of the RAS and RAF protein families, such as certain melanomas. Combinations of MEK1/2 inhibitors and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and/or other targeted agents are being studied to expand the efficacy of this class of agents. Identifying predictive biomarkers, and delineating de novo and acquired resistance mechanisms are essential for the future clinical development of MEK inhibitors. We discuss the clinical experience with MEK inhibitors to date, and consider the novel approaches to MEK-inhibitor therapy that might improve outcomes and lead to the wider use of such treatments.},

  ABSTRACT = {The inherent complexity of thermodynamic coupling in proteins presents a major challenge in understanding and engineering protein function. Recent work has argued that the study of proteins can be simplified by the use of correlated mutations in the evolutionary record to locate a small subset of thermodynamically coupled residues that participate in functionally important, evolutionarily conserved energetic pathways. To test this hypothesis, we examined the predictions of correlated mutation algorithms for a number of proteins for which coupling between residues has been determined by analysis of double mutant cycles. We find that correlated mutation algorithms can find residue pairs that are physically close and that physically close residue pairs tend to be thermodynamically coupled. We find little evidence, however, for the hypothesis that thermodynamic coupling is limited to the subset of evolutionarily constrained residue positions.},

We examined the properties of four different methods for detecting these correlated mutations. On both simple, artificial alignments and real alignments from the Pfam database, we found a surprising lack of agreement between the four correlated mutation methods. We argue that these differences are caused in part by differing sensitivities to background conservation.

  ABSTRACT = {The Shannon entropy is a common way of measuring conservation of sites in multiple sequence alignments, and has also been extended with the relative Shannon entropy to account for background frequencies. The von Neumann entropy is another extension of the Shannon entropy, adapted from quantum mechanics in order to account for amino acid similarities. However, there is yet no relative von Neumann entropy defined for sequence analysis. We introduce a new definition of the von Neumann entropy for use in sequence analysis, which we found to perform better than the previous definition. We also introduce the relative von Neumann entropy and a way of parametrizing this in order to obtain the Shannon entropy, the relative Shannon entropy and the von Neumann entropy at special parameter values. We performed an exhaustive search of this parameter space and found better predictions of catalytic sites compared to any of the previously used entropies.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose the use of the information-theoretical entrophy, S = -sigman pi log2 pi, as a measure of variability at a given position in a set of aligned sequences. pi stands for the fraction of times the i-th type appears at a position. For protein sequences, the sum has up to 20 terms, for nucleotide sequences, up to 4 terms, and for codon sequences, up to 61 terms. We compare S and Vs, a related measure, in detail with Vk, the traditional measure of immunoglobulin sequence variability, both in the abstract and as applied to the immunoglobulins. We conclude that S has desirable mathematical properties that Vk lacks and has intuitive and statistical meanings that accord well with the notion of variability. We find that Vk and the S-based measures are highly correlated for the immunoglobulins. We show by analysis of sequence data and by means of a mathematical model that this correlation is due to a strong tendency for the frequency of occurrence of amino acid types at a given position to be log-linear. It is not known whether the immunoglobulins are typical or atypical of protein families in this regard, nor is the origin of the observed rank-frequency distribution obvious, although we discuss several possible etiologies.},

  ABSTRACT = {Information theory (IT) addresses the analysis of communication systems and has been widely applied in molecular biology. In particular, alignment-free sequence analysis and comparison greatly benefited from concepts derived from IT, such as entropy and mutual information. This review covers several aspects of IT applications, ranging from genome global analysis and comparison, including block-entropy estimation and resolution-free metrics based on iterative maps, to local analysis, comprising the classification of motifs, prediction of transcription factor binding sites and sequence characterization based on linguistic complexity and entropic profiles. IT has also been applied to high-level correlations that combine DNA, RNA or protein features with sequence-independent properties, such as gene mapping and phenotype analysis, and has also provided models based on communication systems theory to describe information transmission channels at the cell level and also during evolutionary processes. While not exhaustive, this review attempts to categorize existing methods and to indicate their relation with broader transversal topics such as genomic signatures, data compression and complexity, time series analysis and phylogenetic classification, providing a resource for future developments in this promising area.},

  ABSTRACT = {Evolutionary conservation derived from a multiple sequence alignment is a powerful indicator of the functional significance of a residue, and it can help to predict active sites, ligand-binding sites, and protein interaction interfaces. The results of the existing algorithms in identifying the residue's conservation strongly depend on the sequence alignment, making the results highly variable. Here, by introducing the amino acid similarity matrix, we propose a novel gap-treating approach by combining the evolutionary information and von Neumann entropies to compute the residue conservation scores. It is indicated through a series of tested results that the new approach is quite encouraging and promising and may become a useful tool in complementing the existing methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {Currently, there are two types of drugs on the market: orthosteric, which bind at the active site; and allosteric, which bind elsewhere on the protein surface, and allosterically change the conformation of the protein binding site. In this perspective we argue that the different mechanisms through which the two drug types affect protein activity and their potential pitfalls call for different considerations in drug design. The key problem facing orthosteric drugs is side effects which can occur by drug binding to homologous proteins sharing a similar binding site. Hence, orthosteric drugs should have very high affinity to the target; this would allow a low dosage to selectively achieve the goal of target-only binding. By contrast, allosteric drugs work by shifting the free energy landscape. Their binding to the protein surface perturbs the protein surface atoms, and the perturbation propagates like waves, finally reaching the binding site. Effective drugs should have atoms in good contact with the 'right' protein atoms; that is, the contacts should elicit propagation waves optimally reaching the protein binding site target. While affinity is important, the design should consider the protein conformational ensemble and the preferred propagation states. We provide examples from functional in vivo scenarios for both types of cases, and suggest how high potency can be achieved in allosteric drug development.},

  ABSTRACT = {X-ray or NMR structures of proteins are often derived without their ligands, and even when the structure of a full complex is available, the area of contact that is functionally and energetically significant may be a specialized subset of the geometric interface deduced from the spatial proximity between ligands. Thus, even after a structure is solved, it remains a major theoretical and experimental goal to localize protein functional interfaces and understand the role of their constituent residues. The evolutionary trace method is a systematic, transparent and novel predictive technique that identifies active sites and functional interfaces in proteins with known structure. It is based on the extraction of functionally important residues from sequence conservation patterns in homologous proteins, and on their mapping onto the protein surface to generate clusters identifying functional interfaces. The SH2 and SH3 modular signaling domains and the DNA binding domain of the nuclear hormone receptors provide tests for the accuracy and validity of our method. In each case, the evolutionary trace delineates the functional epitope and identifies residues critical to binding specificity. Based on mutational evolutionary analysis and on the structural homology of protein families, this simple and versatile approach should help focus site-directed mutagenesis studies of structure-function relationships in macromolecules, as well as studies of specificity in molecular recognition. More generally, it provides an evolutionary perspective for judging the functional or structural role of each residue in protein structure.},

  ABSTRACT = {G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation mediated by ligand-induced structural reorganization of its helices is poorly understood. To determine the universal elements of this conformational switch, we used evolutionary tracing (ET) to identify residue positions commonly important in diverse GPCRs. When mapped onto the rhodopsin structure, these trace residues cluster into a network of contacts from the retinal binding site to the G protein-coupling loops. Their roles in a generic transduction mechanism were verified by 211 of 239 published mutations that caused functional defects. When grouped according to the nature of the defects, these residues sub-divided into three striking sub-clusters: a trigger region, where mutations mostly affect ligand binding, a coupling region near the cytoplasmic interface to the G protein, where mutations affect G protein activation, and a linking core in between where mutations cause constitutive activity and other defects. Differential ET analysis of the opsin family revealed an additional set of opsin-specific residues, several of which form part of the retinal binding pocket, and are known to cause functional defects upon mutation. To test the predictive power of ET, we introduced novel mutations in bovine rhodopsin at a globally important position, Leu-79, and at an opsin-specific position, Trp-175. Both were functionally critical, causing constitutive G protein activation of the mutants and rapid loss of regeneration after photobleaching. These results define in GPCRs a canonical signal transduction mechanism where ligand binding induces conformational changes propagated through adjacent trigger, linking core, and coupling regions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Nuclear receptors are ubiquitous eukaryotic ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate gene expression through varied interactions. However, the highly conserved functional sites known today seem insufficient to explain receptor specific recruitment of different coactivator and corepressor proteins and regulation of transcription. To search for new receptor-subtype specific functional sites, we applied difference evolutionary trace (difference ET) analysis to the ligand binding domain of steroid receptors, a subgroup of the nuclear receptor (NR) family. This computational approach identified a new functional site located on a surface opposite to currently known protein-protein interaction sites and distinct from the ligand binding pocket. Strikingly, the literature shows that in vivo variations at residues in the new site are linked to androgen resistance and leukemia, and our own targeted mutations to this site lower but do not eradicate transcriptional activation by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), with reduced ligand binding affinity and SRC-1 interaction. Thus, these data demonstrate that this evolutionary important surface can function as an allosteric site that modulates some but not all receptor binding interactions. Evolutionary analysis further shows that this allosteric regulatory site is shared among all NRs from groups 2 (HNF4-like) and 4 (NGFIB-like), suggesting a role among many nuclear receptors. Its concave structure, hydrophobic composition, and residue variability among nuclear receptors further suggest that it would be amenable for specific drug design. This highlights the power of evolutionary information for the identification of new functional sites even in a protein family as well studied as NRs.},

  ABSTRACT = {G protein-coupled receptors for dopamine and serotonin control signaling pathways targeted by many psychoactive drugs. A puzzle is how receptors with similar functions and nearly identical binding site structures, such as D2 dopamine receptors and 5-HT2A serotonin receptors, could evolve a mechanism that discriminates stringently in their cellular responses between endogenous neurotransmitters. We used the Difference Evolutionary Trace (Difference-ET) and residue-swapping to uncover two distinct sets of specificity-determining sequence positions. One at the ligand-binding pocket determines the relative affinities for these two ligands, and a distinct, surprising set of positions outside the binding site determines whether a bound ligand can trigger the conformational rearrangement leading to G protein activation. Thus one site specifies affinity while the other encodes a filter for efficacy. These findings demonstrate that allosteric pathways linking distant interactions via alternate conformational states enforce specificity independently of the ligand-binding site, such that either one may be rationally rekeyed to different ligands. The conversion of a dopamine receptor effectively into a serotonin receptor illustrates the plasticity of GPCR signaling during evolution, or in pathological states, and suggests new approaches to drug discovery, targeting both classes of sites.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) generated for a protein can be used to characterise residues by means of a statistical analysis of single columns. In addition to the examination of individual positions, the investigation of co-variation of amino acid frequencies offers insights into function and evolution of the protein and residues. RESULTS: We introduce conn(k), a novel parameter for the characterisation of individual residues. For each residue k, conn(k) is the number of most extreme signals of co-evolution. These signals were deduced from a normalised mutual information (MI) value U(k, l) computed for all pairs of residues k, l. We demonstrate that conn(k) is a more robust indicator than an individual MI-value for the prediction of residues most plausibly important for the evolution of a protein. This proposition was inferred by means of statistical methods. It was further confirmed by the analysis of several proteins. A server, which computes conn(k)-values is available at http://www-bioinf.uni-regensburg.de. CONCLUSION: The algorithms H2r, which analyses MSAs and computes conn(k)-values, characterises a specific class of residues. In contrast to strictly conserved ones, these residues possess some flexibility in the composition of side chains. However, their allocation is sensibly balanced with several other positions, as indicated by conn(k).},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: The identification of functionally important residue positions is an important task of computational biology. Methods of correlation analysis allow for the identification of pairs of residue positions, whose occupancy is mutually dependent due to constraints imposed by protein structure or function. A common measure assessing these dependencies is the mutual information, which is based on Shannon's information theory that utilizes probabilities only. Consequently, such approaches do not consider the similarity of residue pairs, which may degrade the algorithm's performance. One typical algorithm is H2r, which characterizes each individual residue position k by the conn(k)-value, which is the number of significantly correlated pairs it belongs to. RESULTS: To improve specificity of H2r, we developed a revised algorithm, named H2rs, which is based on the von Neumann entropy (vNE). To compute the corresponding mutual information, a matrix A is required, which assesses the similarity of residue pairs. We determined A by deducing substitution frequencies from contacting residue pairs observed in the homologs of 35 809 proteins, whose structure is known. In analogy to H2r, the enhanced algorithm computes a normalized conn(k)-value. Within the framework of H2rs, only statistically significant vNE values were considered. To decide on significance, the algorithm calculates a p-value by performing a randomization test for each individual pair of residue positions. The analysis of a large in silico testbed demonstrated that specificity and precision were higher for H2rs than for H2r and two other methods of correlation analysis. The gain in prediction quality is further confirmed by a detailed assessment of five well-studied enzymes. The outcome of H2rs and of a method that predicts contacting residue positions (PSICOV) overlapped only marginally. H2rs can be downloaded from http://www-bioinf.uni-regensburg.de. CONCLUSIONS: Considering substitution frequencies for residue pairs by means of the von Neumann entropy and a p-value improved the success rate in identifying important residue positions. The integration of proven statistical concepts and normalization allows for an easier comparison of results obtained with different proteins. Comparing the outcome of the local method H2rs and of the global method PSICOV indicates that such methods supplement each other and have different scopes of application.},

  ABSTRACT = {Covariation between positions in a multiple sequence alignment may reflect structural, functional, and/or phylogenetic constraints and can be analyzed by a wide variety of methods. We explored several of these methods for their ability to identify covarying positions related to the divergence of a protein family at different hierarchical levels. Specifically, we compared seven methods on a model system composed of three nested sets of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in which a divergence event occurred. The covariation methods analyzed were based on: $\chi$2 test, mutual information, substitution matrices, and perturbation methods. We first analyzed the dependence of the covariation scores on residue conservation (measured by sequence entropy), and then we analyzed the networking structure of the top pairs. Two methods out of seven--OMES (Observed minus Expected Squared) and ELSC (Explicit Likelihood of Subset Covariation)--favored pairs with intermediate entropy and a networking structure with a central residue involved in several high-scoring pairs. This networking structure was observed for the three sequence sets. In each case, the central residue corresponded to a residue known to be crucial for the evolution of the GPCR family and the subfamily specificity. These central residues can be viewed as evolutionary hubs, in relation with an epistasis-based mechanism of functional divergence within a protein family.},

  ABSTRACT = {Correlated amino acid substitution algorithms attempt to discover groups of residues that co-fluctuate due to either structural or functional constraints. Although these algorithms could inform both ab initio protein folding calculations and evolutionary studies, their utility for these purposes has been hindered by a lack of confidence in their predictions due to hard to control sources of error. To complicate matters further, naive users are confronted with a multitude of methods to choose from, in addition to the mechanics of assembling and pruning a dataset. We first introduce a new pair scoring method, called ZNMI (Z-scored-product Normalized Mutual Information), which drastically improves the performance of mutual information for co-fluctuating residue prediction. Second and more important, we recast the process of finding coevolving residues in proteins as a data-processing pipeline inspired by the medical imaging literature. We construct an ensemble of alignment partitions that can be used in a cross-validation scheme to assess the effects of choices made during the procedure on the resulting predictions. This pipeline sensitivity study gives a measure of reproducibility (how similar are the predictions given perturbations to the pipeline?) and accuracy (are residue pairs with large couplings on average close in tertiary structure?). We choose a handful of published methods, along with ZNMI, and compare their reproducibility and accuracy on three diverse protein families. We find that (i) of the algorithms tested, while none appear to be both highly reproducible and accurate, ZNMI is one of the most accurate by far and (ii) while users should be wary of predictions drawn from a single alignment, considering an ensemble of sub-alignments can help to determine both highly accurate and reproducible couplings. Our cross-validation approach should be of interest both to developers and end users of algorithms that try to detect correlated amino acid substitutions.},

  ABSTRACT = {MISTIC (mutual information server to infer coevolution) is a web server for graphical representation of the information contained within a MSA (multiple sequence alignment) and a complete analysis tool for Mutual Information networks in protein families. The server outputs a graphical visualization of several information-related quantities using a circos representation. This provides an integrated view of the MSA in terms of (i) the mutual information (MI) between residue pairs, (ii) sequence conservation and (iii) the residue cumulative and proximity MI scores. Further, an interactive interface to explore and characterize the MI network is provided. Several tools are offered for selecting subsets of nodes from the network for visualization. Node coloring can be set to match different attributes, such as conservation, cumulative MI, proximity MI and secondary structure. Finally, a zip file containing all results can be downloaded. The server is available at http://mistic.leloir.org.ar. In summary, MISTIC allows for a comprehensive, compact, visually rich view of the information contained within an MSA in a manner unique to any other publicly available web server. In particular, the use of circos representation of MI networks and the visualization of the cumulative MI and proximity MI concepts is novel.},

  ABSTRACT = {Quantitative analyses of biological sequences generally proceed under the assumption that individual DNA or protein sequence elements vary independently. However, this assumption is not biologically realistic because sequence elements often vary in a concerted manner resulting from common ancestry and structural or functional constraints. We calculated intersite associations among aligned protein sequences by using mutual information. To discriminate associations resulting from common ancestry from those resulting from structural or functional constraints, we used a parametric bootstrap algorithm to construct replicate data sets. These data are expected to have intersite associations resulting solely from phylogeny. By comparing the distribution of our association statistic for the replicate data against that calculated for empirical data, we were able to assign a probability that two sites covaried resulting from structural or functional constraint rather than phylogeny. We tested our method by using an alignment of 237 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein domains. Comparison of our results against a solved three-dimensional structure confirmed the identification of several sites important to function and structure of the bHLH domain. This analytical procedure has broad utility as a first step in the identification of sites that are important to biological macromolecular structure and function when a solved structure is unavailable.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Mutual information (MI) theory is often applied to predict positional correlations in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to make possible the analysis of those positions structurally or functionally important in a given fold or protein family. Accurate identification of coevolving positions in protein sequences is difficult due to the high background signal imposed by phylogeny and noise. Several methods have been proposed using MI to identify coevolving amino acids in protein families. RESULTS: After evaluating two current methods, we demonstrate how the use of sequence-weighting techniques to reduce sequence redundancy and low-count corrections to account for small number of observations in limited size sequence families, can significantly improve the predictability of MI. The evaluation is made on large sets of both in silico-generated alignments as well as on biological sequence data. The methods included in the analysis are the APC (average product correction) and RCW (row-column weighting) methods. The best performing method was APC including sequence-weighting and low-count corrections. The use of sequence-permutations to calculate a MI rescaling is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy and allows for direct comparison of information values across protein families. Finally, we demonstrate how a lower bound of 400 sequences <62{\%} identical is needed in an MSA in order to achieve meaningful predictive performances. With our contribution, we achieve a noteworthy improvement on the current procedures to determine coevolution and residue contacts, and we believe that this will have potential impacts on the understanding of protein structure, function and folding.},

  ABSTRACT = {Correlations between protein structures and amino acid sequences are widely used for protein structure prediction. For example, secondary structure predictors generally use correlations between a secondary structure sequence and corresponding primary structure sequence, whereas threading algorithms and similar tertiary structure predictors typically incorporate interresidue contact potentials. To investigate the relative importance of these sequence-structure interactions, we measured the mutual information among the primary structure, secondary structure and side-chain surface exposure, both for adjacent residues along the amino acid sequence and for tertiary structure contacts between residues distantly separated along the backbone. We found that local interactions along the amino acid chain are far more important than non-local contacts and that correlations between proximate amino acids are essentially uninformative. This suggests that knowledge-based contact potentials may be less important for structure predication than is generally believed.},

  ABSTRACT = {The crystal structure of the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics target APC35832, a 14.7-kDa cytosolic protein from Bacillus stearothermophilus, has been determined at 1.3 A resolution by the single anomalous diffraction method from a mercury soaked crystal. The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

Here, we reveal a structural organization distinct from this traditional hierarchy by statistical analysis of correlated evolution between amino acids. Applied to the S1A serine proteases, the analysis indicates a decomposition of the protein into three quasi-independent groups of correlated amino acids that we term "protein sectors." Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family. Functionally relevant sectors are evident in other protein families as well, suggesting that they may be general features of proteins. We propose that sectors represent a structural organization of proteins that reflects their evolutionary histories.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent work indicates a general architecture for proteins in which sparse networks of physically contiguous and coevolving amino acids underlie basic aspects of structure and function. These networks, termed sectors, are spatially organized such that active sites are linked to many surface sites distributed throughout the structure. Using the metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase as a model system, we show that: (1) the sector is strongly correlated to a network of residues undergoing millisecond conformational fluctuations associated with enzyme catalysis, and (2) sector-connected surface sites are statistically preferred locations for the emergence of allosteric control in vivo. Thus, sectors represent an evolutionarily conserved "wiring" mechanism that can enable perturbations at specific surface positions to rapidly initiate conformational control over protein function. These findings suggest that sectors enable the evolution of intermolecular communication and regulation.},

Construction of artificial protein sequences directed only by the SCA showed that the information extracted by this analysis is sufficient to engineer the WW fold at atomic resolution. Here, we demonstrate that these artificial WW sequences function like their natural counterparts, showing class-specific recognition of proline-containing target peptides. Consistent with SCA predictions, a distributed network of residues mediates functional specificity in WW domains. The ability to recapitulate natural-like function in designed sequences shows that a relatively small quantity of sequence information is sufficient to specify the global energetics of amino acid interactions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Classical studies show that for many proteins, the information required for specifying the tertiary structure is contained in the amino acid sequence. Here, we attempt to define the sequence rules for specifying a protein fold by computationally creating artificial protein sequences using only statistical information encoded in a multiple sequence alignment and no tertiary structure information. Experimental testing of libraries of artificial WW domain sequences shows that a simple statistical energy function capturing coevolution between amino acid residues is necessary and sufficient to specify sequences that fold into native structures. The artificial proteins show thermodynamic stabilities similar to natural WW domains, and structure determination of one artificial protein shows excellent agreement with the WW fold at atomic resolution. The relative simplicity of the information used for creating sequences suggests a marked reduction to the potential complexity of the protein-folding problem.},

  ABSTRACT = {A fundamental goal in cellular signaling is to understand allosteric communication, the process by which signals originating at one site in a protein propagate reliably to affect distant functional sites. The general principles of protein structure that underlie this process remain unknown. Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) is a statistical technique that uses evolutionary data of a protein family to measure correlation between distant functional sites and suggests allosteric communication. In proteins, very distant and small interactions between collections of amino acids provide the communication which can be important for signaling process. In this paper, we present the SCA of protein alignment of the esterase family (pfam ID: PF00756) containing the sequence of antigen 85C secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify a subset of interacting residues. Clustering analysis of the pairwise correlation highlighted seven important residue positions in the esterase family alignments. These residues were then mapped on the crystal structure of antigen 85C (PDB ID: 1DQZ). The mapping revealed correlation between 3 distant residues (Asp38, Leu123 and Met125) and suggests allosteric communication between them. This information can be used for a new drug against this fatal disease.},

  ABSTRACT = {Statistical analysis of protein evolution suggests a design for natural proteins in which sparse networks of coevolving amino acids (termed sectors) comprise the essence of three-dimensional structure and function. However, proteins are also subject to pressures deriving from the dynamics of the evolutionary process itself--the ability to tolerate mutation and to be adaptive to changing selection pressures. To understand the relationship of the sector architecture to these properties, we developed a high-throughput quantitative method for a comprehensive single-mutation study in which every position is substituted individually to every other amino acid. Using a PDZ domain (PSD95(pdz3)) model system, we show that sector positions are functionally sensitive to mutation, whereas non-sector positions are more tolerant to substitution. In addition, we find that adaptation to a new binding specificity initiates exclusively through variation within sector residues. A combination of just two sector mutations located near and away from the ligand-binding site suffices to switch the binding specificity of PSD95(pdz3) quantitatively towards a class-switching ligand. The localization of functional constraint and adaptive variation within the sector has important implications for understanding and engineering proteins.},

  ABSTRACT = {Regulation of protein interaction domains is required for cellular signaling dynamics. Here, we show that the PDZ protein interaction domain from the cell polarity protein Par-6 is regulated by the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Cdc42 binds to a CRIB domain adjacent to the PDZ domain, increasing the affinity of the Par-6 PDZ for its carboxy-terminal ligand by approximately 13-fold. Par-6 PDZ regulation is required for function as mutational disruption of Cdc42-Par-6 PDZ coupling leads to inactivation of Par-6 in polarized MDCK epithelial cells. Structural analysis reveals that the free PDZ domain has several deviations from the canonical PDZ conformation that account for its low ligand affinity. Regulation results from a Cdc42-induced conformational transition in the CRIB-PDZ module that causes the PDZ to assume a canonical, high-affinity PDZ conformation. The coupled CRIB and PDZ architecture of Par-6 reveals how simple binding domains can be combined to yield complex regulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Members of the G protein superfamily contain nucleotide-dependent switches that dictate the specificity of their interactions with binding partners. Using a sequence-based method termed statistical coupling analysis (SCA), we have attempted to identify the allosteric core of these proteins, the network of amino acid residues that couples the domains responsible for nucleotide binding and protein-protein interactions. One-third of the 38 residues identified by SCA were mutated in the G protein Gs alpha, and the interactions of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate- and GDP-bound mutant proteins were tested with both adenylyl cyclase (preferential binding to GTP-Gs alpha) and the G protein beta gamma subunit complex (preferential binding to GDP-Gs alpha). A two-state allosteric model predicts that mutation of residues that control the equilibrium between GDP- and GTP-bound conformations of the protein will cause the ratio of affinities of these species for adenylyl cyclase and G beta gamma to vary in a reciprocal fashion. Observed results were consistent with this prediction. The network of residues identified by the SCA appears to comprise a core allosteric mechanism conferring nucleotide-dependent switching; the specific features of different G protein family members are built on this core.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allosteric communication underlies ligand-dependent transcriptional responses mediated by nuclear receptors. While studies have elucidated many of the components involved in this process, the energetic architecture within the receptor protein that mediates allostery remains unknown. Using a sequence-based method designed to detect coevolution of amino acids in a protein, termed the statistical coupling analysis (SCA), we identify a network of energetically coupled residues that link the functional surfaces of nuclear receptor ligand binding domains. Functional analysis of these predicted residues demonstrates their participation in an allosteric network that governs the ability of heterodimeric receptors to activate transcription in response to ligand binding by either partner. Interestingly, mutation of a single network residue can discriminate between receptor activation by endocrine, dietary, and synthetic agonists. These results reveal a structural network required for RXR heterodimer allosteric communication and suggest that the specificity of ligand response and permissivity coevolved to enable signal discrimination.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allosteric coupling between protein domains is fundamental to many cellular processes. For example, Hsp70 molecular chaperones use ATP binding by their actin-like N-terminal ATPase domain to control substrate interactions in their C-terminal substrate-binding domain, a reaction that is critical for protein folding in cells. Here, we generalize the statistical coupling analysis to simultaneously evaluate co-evolution between protein residues and functional divergence between sequences in protein sub-families. Applying this method in the Hsp70/110 protein family, we identify a sparse but structurally contiguous group of co-evolving residues called a 'sector', which is an attribute of the allosteric Hsp70 sub-family that links the functional sites of the two domains across a specific interdomain interface. Mutagenesis of Escherichia coli DnaK supports the conclusion that this interdomain sector underlies the allosteric coupling in this protein family. The identification of the Hsp70 sector provides a basis for further experiments to understand the mechanism of allostery and introduces the idea that cooperativity between interacting proteins or protein domains can be mediated by shared sectors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding the molecular principles that govern allosteric communication is an important goal in protein science. One way allostery could be transmitted is via sparse energetic networks of residues, and one such evolutionary conserved network was identified in the PDZ domain family of proteins by multiple sequence alignment [Lockless SW, Ranganathan R (1999) Science 286:295-299]. We have reassessed the energetic coupling of these residues by double mutant cycles together with ligand binding and stability experiments and found that coupling is not a special property of the coevolved network of residues in PDZ domains. The observed coupling for ligand binding is better explained by a distance relationship, where residues close in space are more likely to couple than distal residues. Our study demonstrates that statistical coupling from sequence analysis is not necessarily a reporter of energetic coupling and allostery.},

PDZ (post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1) domains are small, protein-protein binding modules that can use multiple surfaces for docking diverse molecules. Furthermore, these domains have long-range energetic couplings that link the ligand-binding site to distal regions of the structure. Here, we show that allosteric behavior in a representative member of the PDZ domain family may be directly detected using side-chain methyl dynamics measurements. The changes in side-chain dynamics parameters in the second PDZ domain from the human tyrosine phosphatase 1E (hPTP1E) were determined upon binding a peptide target. Long-range dynamic effects were detected that correspond to previously observed pair-wise energetic couplings.

  ABSTRACT = {Allosteric interactions between residues that are spatially apart and well separated in sequence are important in the function of multimeric proteins as well as single-domain proteins. This observation suggests that, among the residues that are involved in long-range communications, mutation at one site should affect interactions at a distant site. By adopting a sequence-based approach, we present an automated approach that uses a generalization of the familiar sequence entropy in conjunction with a coupled two-way clustering algorithm, to predict the network of interactions that trigger allosteric interactions in proteins. We use the method to identify the subset of dynamically important residues in three families, namely, the small PDZ family, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), and the Lectins, which are cell-adhesion receptors that mediate the tethering and rolling of leukocytes on inflamed endothelium. For the PDZ and GPCR families, our procedure predicts, in agreement with previous studies, a network containing a small number of residues that are involved in their function. Application to the Lectin family reveals a network of residues interspersed throughout the C-terminal end of the structure that are responsible for binding to ligands. Based on our results and previous studies, we propose that functional robustness requires that only a small subset of distantly connected residues be involved in transmitting allosteric signals in proteins.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a coupled two-way clustering approach to gene microarray data analysis. The main idea is to identify subsets of the genes and samples, such that when one of these is used to cluster the other, stable and significant partitions emerge. The search for such subsets is a computationally complex task. We present an algorithm, based on iterative clustering, that performs such a search. This analysis is especially suitable for gene microarray data, where the contributions of a variety of biological mechanisms to the gene expression levels are entangled in a large body of experimental data. The method was applied to two gene microarray data sets, on colon cancer and leukemia. By identifying relevant subsets of the data and focusing on them we were able to discover partitions and correlations that were masked and hidden when the full dataset was used in the analysis. Some of these partitions have clear biological interpretation; others can serve to identify possible directions for future research.},

  ABSTRACT = {A contact map is a 2D derivative of the 3D structure of proteins, containing various residue-residue (RR) contacts within the structure. Contact maps can be used for the reconstruction of structure with high accuracy and can be predicted from the amino acid sequence. Therefore understanding the various properties of contact maps is an important step in protein structure prediction. For investigating basic properties of contact formation and contact clusters we set up an integrated system called Contact Map Web Viewer, or CMWeb for short. The server can be used to visualize contact maps, to link contacts and to show them both in 3D structures and in multiple sequence alignments and to calculate various statistics on contacts. Moreover, we have implemented five contact prediction methods in the CMWeb server to visualize the predicted and real RR contacts in one contact map. The results of other RR contact prediction methods can be uploaded as a benchmark test onto the server as well. All of these functionality is behind a web server, thus for using our application only a Java-capable web browser is needed, no further program installation is required. The CMWeb is freely accessible at http://cmweb.enzim.hu.},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

  ABSTRACT = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

  ABSTRACT = {Bacteria use two-component signal transduction systems (TCS) extensively to sense and react to external stimuli. In these, a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase (SK) autophosphorylates in response to an environmental stimulus and transfers the phosphoryl group to a transcription factor/response regulator (RR) that mediates the cellular response. The complex between these two proteins is ruled by transient interactions, which provides a challenge to experimental structure determination techniques. The functional and structural homolog of an SK/RR pair Spo0B/Spo0F, however, has been structurally resolved. Here, we describe a method capable of generating structural models of such transient protein complexes. By using existing structures of the individual proteins, our method combines bioinformatically derived contact residue information with molecular dynamics simulations. We find crystal resolution accuracy with existing crystallographic data when reconstituting the known system Spo0B/Spo0F. Using this approach, we introduce a complex structure of TM0853/TM0468 as an exemplary SK/RR TCS, consistent with all experimentally available data.},

  ABSTRACT = {Predictive understanding of the myriads of signal transduction pathways in a cell is an outstanding challenge of systems biology. Such pathways are primarily mediated by specific but transient protein-protein interactions, which are difficult to study experimentally. In this study, we dissect the specificity of protein-protein interactions governing two-component signaling (TCS) systems ubiquitously used in bacteria. Exploiting the large number of sequenced bacterial genomes and an operon structure which packages many pairs of interacting TCS proteins together, we developed a computational approach to extract a molecular interaction code capturing the preferences of a small but critical number of directly interacting residue pairs. This code is found to reflect physical interaction mechanisms, with the strongest signal coming from charged amino acids. It is used to predict the specificity of TCS interaction: Our results compare favorably to most available experimental results, including the prediction of 7 (out of 8 known) interaction partners of orphan signaling proteins in Caulobacter crescentus. Surveying among the available bacterial genomes, our results suggest 15∼25{\%} of the TCS proteins could participate in out-of-operon "crosstalks". Additionally, we predict clusters of crosstalking candidates, expanding from the anecdotally known examples in model organisms. The tools and results presented here can be used to guide experimental studies towards a system-level understanding of two-component signaling.},

This includes not only proteins' native structures, but also all their respective functional states, including functionally important intermediates. Here, we reveal a signature of functionally important states in several protein families, using direct coupling analysis, which detects residue pair coevolution of protein sequence composition. This signature is exploited in a protein structure-based model to uncover conformational diversity, including hidden functional configurations. We uncovered, with high resolution (mean {\~{}}1.9 {Å} rmsd for nonapo structures), different functional structural states for medium to large proteins (200-450 aa) belonging to several distinct families. The combination of direct coupling analysis and the structure-based model also predicts several intermediates or hidden states that are of functional importance. This enhanced sampling is broadly applicable and has direct implications in protein structure determination and the design of ligands or drugs to trap intermediate states.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: The accurate prediction of residue-residue contacts, critical for maintaining the native fold of a protein, remains an open problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. Interest in this long-standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic improvements and the rapid growth in the sizes of sequence families. Progress could have major impacts in both structure and function prediction to name but two benefits. Sequence-based contact predictions are usually made by identifying correlated mutations within multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), most commonly through the information-theoretic approach of calculating mutual information between pairs of sites in proteins. These predictions are often inaccurate because the true covariation signal in the MSA is often masked by biases from many ancillary indirect-coupling or phylogenetic effects. Here we present a novel method, PSICOV, which introduces the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein contact prediction. Our method builds on work which had previously demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly coupled mutation correlations in the MSA. RESULTS: PSICOV displays a mean precision substantially better than the best performing normalized mutual information approach and Bayesian networks. For 118 out of 150 targets, the L/5 (i.e. top-L/5 predictions for a protein of length L) precision for long-range contacts (sequence separation >23) was ≥ 0.5, which represents an improvement sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein structure prediction or model quality assessment.

The hydrophobicity profiles corresponding to the primary structure of 13 naturally occurring mutations partially impairing function, together with 43 artificial non-tolerated mutations were subjected to discriminant analysis, derived from the results of recurrence quantification analysis, coupled to a principal exponents extraction. Eleven (85{\%}) of the naturally occurring mutants and 36 (84{\%}) of the artificial mutants were correctly classified (p < 0.0001). We conclude that this technique may be useful in protein engineering and, in general, in structure-function studies of biopolymers.},

Here, we screened the amino acid sequence landscape in search of sequence-signatures of allostery using Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA) method. A characteristic vector, comprised of 10 features extracted from RQA was defined for amino acid sequences. Using Principal Component Analysis, four factors were found to be important determinants of allosteric behavior. Our sequence-based predictor method shows 82.6{\%} accuracy, 85.7{\%} sensitivity and 77.9{\%} specificity with the current dataset. Further, we show that Laminarity-Mean-hydrophobicity representing repeated hydrophobic patches is the most crucial indicator of allostery. To our best knowledge this is the first report that describes sequence determinants of allostery based on hydrophobicity.

  ABSTRACT = {p53 is mutated in roughly 50{\%} of all human tumors, predominantly in the DNA-binding domain codons. Structural, biochemical, and functional studies have reported that the different p53 mutants possess a broad range of behaviors that include the elimination of the tumor-suppression function of wild-type protein, the acquisition of dominant-negative function over the wild-type form, and the establishment of gain-of-function activities. The contribution of each of these types of mutations to tumor progression, grade of malignancy, and response to anticancer treatments has been so far analyzed only for a few "hot-spots." In an attempt to identify new approaches to systematically characterize the complete spectrum of p53 mutations, we applied recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), a non-linear signal analysis technique, to p53 primary structure. Moving from the study of the p53 hydrophobicity pattern, which revealed important similarities with the singular deterministic structuring of prions, we could statistically discriminate, on a pure amino acid sequence basis, between experimentally characterized DNA-contact defective and conformational p53 mutants with a very high percentage of success. This result indicates that RQA is a mathematical tool particularly advantageous for the development of a database of p53 mutations that integrates epidemiological data with structural and functional categorizations.},

  ABSTRACT = {The paramyxovirus envelope fuses with the host cell membrane by cooperative interaction of two transmembrane glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion (F) glycoprotein. The interaction appears to be finely regulated, as both proteins must derive from the same viral species to obtain a functional interaction. Because HN and F do not form stable complexes, this interaction is poorly characterized. This article demonstrates that a modification of a classical bioinformatic method based on the co-evolution of interacting partners can detect the specificity of the HN and F interaction. The proposed approach relies on a relatively new nonlinear signal analysis technique, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), applied to the hydrophobicity sequences of viral proteins. This technique is able to shed light on the interaction between HN and F proteins in the virus-cell fusion and, more generally, permits the quantitative comparison of nonhomologue protein systems. On the contrary, the same co-evolution approach, based on the classical sequence alignment procedure, was unable to discriminate interacting partners from the general strict correlation existing between the evolution of viral proteins as a whole. The cooperation between HN and F in the fusion process is thus demonstrated by a bioinformatic, purely sequence-dependent, perspective.},

  ABSTRACT = {A data set composed of 1141 proteins representative of all eukaryotic protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot Protein Knowledge base was coded by seven physicochemical properties of amino acid residues. The resulting numerical profiles were submitted to correlation analysis after the application of a linear (simple mean) and a nonlinear (Recurrence Quantification Analysis, RQA) filter. The main RQA variables, Recurrence and Determinism, were subsequently analyzed by Principal Component Analysis. The RQA descriptors showed that (i) within protein sequences is embedded specific information neither present in the codes nor in the amino acid composition and (ii) the most sensitive code for detecting ordered recurrent (deterministic) patterns of residues in protein sequences is the Miyazawa-Jernigan hydrophobicity scale. The most deterministic proteins in terms of autocorrelation properties of primary structures were found (i) to be involved in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and (ii) to display a significantly higher proportion of structural disorder with respect to the average data set. A study of the scaling behavior of the average determinism with the setting parameters of RQA (embedding dimension and radius) allows for the identification of patterns of minimal length (six residues) as possible markers of zones specifically prone to inter- and intramolecular interactions.},

  ABSTRACT = {The aim of this work was to detect allosteric hotspots signatures characterizing protein regions acting as the 'key drivers' of global allosteric conformational change. We computationally estimated the relative strength of intra-molecular interaction in allosteric proteins between two putative allostery-susceptible sites using a co-evolution model based upon the optimization of the cross-correlation in terms of free-energy-transfer hydrophobicity scale (Tanford scale) distribution along the chain. Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (Cross-RQA) applied on the sequences of allostery susceptible sites showed evidence of strong interaction amongst allosteric susceptible sites. This could be due to transient weak molecular bonds between allostery susceptible patches enabling regions far-apart to come together. Further, using a large protein dataset, by comparing allosteric protein set with a randomly generated sequence population as well as a generic protein set, we reconfirmed our earlier findings that hydrophobicity patterning (as formalized by Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) descriptors) may serve as determinant of allostery and its relevance in the transmission of allosteric conformational change. We applied RQA to free-energy-transfer hydrophobicity-transformed amino acid sequences of the allostery dataset to extract allostery specific global sequence features. These free-energy-transfer hydrophobicity-based RQA markers proved to be representative of allosteric signatures and not related to the differences between randomly generated and real proteins. These free-energy-transfer hydrophobicity-based RQA markers when evaluated by pattern recognition tools could distinguish allosteric proteins with 92{\%} accuracy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: With rapid accumulation of sequence data on several species, extracting rational and systematic information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is becoming increasingly important. Currently, there is a plethora of computational methods for investigating coupled evolutionary changes in pairs of positions along the amino acid sequence, and making inferences on structure and function. Yet, the significance of coevolution signals remains to be established. Also, a large number of false positives (FPs) arise from insufficient MSA size, phylogenetic background and indirect couplings. RESULTS: Here, a set of 16 pairs of non-interacting proteins is thoroughly examined to assess the effectiveness and limitations of different methods. The analysis shows that recent computationally expensive methods designed to remove biases from indirect couplings outperform others in detecting tertiary structural contacts as well as eliminating intermolecular FPs; whereas traditional methods such as mutual information benefit from refinements such as shuffling, while being highly efficient. Computations repeated with 2,330 pairs of protein families from the Negatome database corroborated these results. Finally, using a training dataset of 162 families of proteins, we propose a combined method that outperforms existing individual methods. Overall, the study provides simple guidelines towards the choice of suitable methods and strategies based on available MSA size and computing resources.

  ABSTRACT = {The maintenance of protein function and structure constrains the evolution of amino acid sequences. This fact can be exploited to interpret correlated mutations observed in a sequence family as an indication of probable physical contact in three dimensions. Here we present a simple and general method to analyze correlations in mutational behavior between different positions in a multiple sequence alignment. We then use these correlations to predict contact maps for each of 11 protein families and compare the result with the contacts determined by crystallography. For the most strongly correlated residue pairs predicted to be in contact, the prediction accuracy ranges from 37 to 68{\%} and the improvement ratio relative to a random prediction from 1.4 to 5.1. Predicted contact maps can be used as input for the calculation of protein tertiary structure, either from sequence information alone or in combination with experimental information.},

  ABSTRACT = {Protein evolution depends on intramolecular coevolutionary networks whose complexity is proportional to the underlying functional and structural interactions among sites. Here we present a novel approach that vastly improves the sensitivity of previous methods for detecting coevolution through a weighted comparison of divergence between amino acid sites. The analysis of the HIV-1 Gag protein detected convergent adaptive coevolutionary events responsible for the selective variability emerging between subtypes. Coevolution analysis and functional data for heat-shock proteins, Hsp90 and GroEL, highlight that almost all detected coevolving sites are functionally or structurally important. The results support previous suggestions pinpointing the complex interdomain functional interactions within these proteins and we propose new amino acid sites as important for interdomain functional communication. Three-dimensional information sheds light on the functional and structural constraints governing the coevolution between sites. Our covariation analyses propose two types of coevolving sites in agreement with previous reports: pairs of sites spatially proximal, where compensatory mutations could maintain the local structure stability, and clusters of distant sites located in functional domains, suggesting a functional dependency between them. All sites detected under adaptive evolution in these proteins belong to coevolution groups, further underlining the importance of testing for coevolution in selective constraints analyses.},

  ABSTRACT = {Interprotein contact prediction using multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is a useful approach to help detect protein-protein interfaces. Different computational methods have been developed in recent years as an approximation to solve this problem. However, as there are discrepancies in the results provided by them, there is still no consensus on which is the best performing methodology. To address this problem, I-COMS (interprotein COrrelated Mutations Server) is presented. I-COMS allows to estimate covariation between residues of different proteins by four different covariation methods. It provides a graphical and interactive output that helps compare results obtained using different methods. I-COMS automatically builds the required MSA for the calculation and produces a rich visualization of either intraprotein and/or interprotein covariating positions in a circos representation. Furthermore, comparison between any two methods is available as well as the overlap between any or all four methodologies. In addition, as a complementary source of information, a matrix visualization of the corresponding scores is made available and the density plot distribution of the inter, intra and inter+intra scores are calculated. Finally, all the results can be downloaded (including MSAs, scores and graphics) for comparison and visualization and/or for further analysis.},

  ABSTRACT = {Since the cooperative mechanism between interconnected residues plays a critical role in protein functions, the detection of coevolving residues is important for studying various biological functions of proteins. In this work, we developed a new correlated mutation analysis method that shows substantially better prediction accuracy than all other methods. More importantly, the prediction accuracy of our new method is insensitive to the characteristics of the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from which the correlated mutation scores are calculated. Thanks to this desirable property, not only it does it show a good performance even for MSAs automatically generated by sequence homology methodologies, which allows us to build a fully automatic easy-to-use server named CMAT, but its performance is also consistently high on the columns of MSAs containing a high fraction of gaps, which greatly extends the applicability of the correlated mutation analysis. The key development of this work is the joint probability estimation that can be greatly improved by utilizing sequence profile as prior knowledge, which is shown to be highly beneficial to the correlated mutation analysis and its applications. From the computational perspective, we made two important findings; the sequence profile can be used to estimate the pseudocounts, and the consistency rule on joint probabilities and marginal probabilities is important for accurately estimating the joint probability.

  ABSTRACT = {Experimental approaches for the identification of functionally important regions on the surface of a protein involve mutagenesis, in which exposed residues are replaced one after another while the change in binding to other proteins or changes in activity are recorded. However, practical considerations limit the use of these methods to small-scale studies, precluding a full mapping of all the functionally important residues on the surface of a protein. We present here an alternative approach involving the use of evolutionary data in the form of multiple-sequence alignment for a protein family to identify hot spots and surface patches that are likely to be in contact with other proteins, domains, peptides, DNA, RNA or ligands. The underlying assumption in this approach is that key residues that are important for binding should be conserved throughout evolution, just like residues that are crucial for maintaining the protein fold, i.e. buried residues. A main limitation in the implementation of this approach is that the sequence space of a protein family may be unevenly sampled, e.g. mammals may be overly represented. Thus, a seemingly conserved position in the alignment may reflect a taxonomically uneven sampling, rather than being indicative of structural or functional importance.

However, determining how observed displacements and predicted motions from these traditionally separate analyses relate to each other, as well as to the evolution of sequence, structure and function within large protein families, remains a considerable challenge. This is in part due to the general lack of tools that integrate information of molecular structure, dynamics and evolution. Results: Here, we describe the integration of new methodologies for evolutionary sequence, structure and simulation analysis into the Bio3D package. This major update includes unique high-throughput normal mode analysis for examining and contrasting the dynamics of related proteins with non-identical sequences and structures, as well as new methods for quantifying dynamical couplings and their residue-wise dissection from correlation network analysis. These new methodologies are integrated with major biomolecular databases as well as established methods for evolutionary sequence and comparative structural analysis. New functionality for directly comparing results derived from normal modes, molecular dynamics and principal component analysis of heterogeneous experimental structure distributions is also included. We demonstrate these integrated capabilities with example applications to dihydrofolate reductase and heterotrimeric G-protein families along with a discussion of the mechanistic insight provided in each case. Conclusions: The integration of structural dynamics and evolutionary analysis in Bio3D enables researchers to go beyond a prediction of single protein dynamics to investigate dynamical features across large protein families.

CorMut is an R package designed to compute correlated mutations in the unit of codon or amino acid mutation. Three classical methods were incorporated, and the computation results can be represented as correlation mutation networks. CorMut also enables the comparison of correlated mutations between two different evolutionary conditions.

  ABSTRACT = {Despite the high degree of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutation in the setting of antiretroviral therapy, the spectrum of possible virus variants appears to be limited by patterns of amino acid covariation. We analyzed patterns of amino acid covariation in protease and RT sequences from more than 7,000 persons infected with HIV-1 subtype B viruses obtained from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). In addition, we examined the relationship between conditional probabilities associated with a pair of mutations and the order in which those mutations developed in viruses for which longitudinal sequence data were available. Patterns of RT covariation were dominated by the distinct clustering of Type I and Type II thymidine analog mutations and the Q151M-associated mutations. Patterns of protease covariation were dominated by the clustering of nelfinavir-associated mutations (D30N and N88D), two main groups of protease inhibitor (PI)-resistance mutations associated either with V82A or L90M, and a tight cluster of mutations associated with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir and the most recently approved PI darunavir. Different patterns of covariation were frequently observed for different mutations at the same position including the RT mutations T69D versus T69N, L74V versus L74I, V75I versus V75M, T215F versus T215Y, and K219Q/E versus K219N/R, and the protease mutations M46I versus M46L, I54V versus I54M/L, and N88D versus N88S. Sequence data from persons with correlated mutations in whom earlier sequences were available confirmed that the conditional probabilities associated with correlated mutation pairs could be used to predict the order in which the mutations were likely to have developed. Whereas accessory nucleoside RT inhibitor-resistance mutations nearly always follow primary nucleoside RT inhibitor-resistance mutations, accessory PI-resistance mutations often preceded primary PI-resistance mutations.},

  ABSTRACT = {Many interesting dynamic properties of biological molecules cannot be simulated directly using molecular dynamics because of nanosecond time scale limitations. These systems are trapped in potential energy minima with high free energy barriers for large numbers of computational steps. The dynamic evolution of many molecular systems occurs through a series of rare events as the system moves from one potential energy basin to another. Therefore, we have proposed a robust bias potential function that can be used in an efficient accelerated molecular dynamics approach to simulate the transition of high energy barriers without any advance knowledge of the location of either the potential energy wells or saddle points. In this method, the potential energy landscape is altered by adding a bias potential to the true potential such that the escape rates from potential wells are enhanced, which accelerates and extends the time scale in molecular dynamics simulations. Our definition of the bias potential echoes the underlying shape of the potential energy landscape on the modified surface, thus allowing for the potential energy minima to be well defined, and hence properly sampled during the simulation. We have shown that our approach, which can be extended to biomolecules, samples the conformational space more efficiently than normal molecular dynamics simulations, and converges to the correct canonical distribution.},

By constructing a boost potential that follows Gaussian distribution, accurate reweighting of the GaMD simulations is achieved using cumulant expansion to the second order.

Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates, GaMD enables unconstrained enhanced sampling of these biomolecules.

  ABSTRACT = {In this work, we critically assess the ability of the all-atom enhanced sampling method accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) to investigate conformational changes in proteins that typically occur on the millisecond time scale. We combine aMD with the inherent power of graphics processor units (GPUs) and apply the implementation to the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). A 500 ns aMD simulation is compared to a previous millisecond unbiased brute force MD simulation carried out on BPTI, showing that the same conformational space is sampled by both approaches. To our knowledge, this represents the first implementation of aMD on GPUs and also the longest aMD simulation of a biomolecule run to date. Our implementation is available to the community in the latest release of the Amber software suite (v12), providing routine access to millisecond events sampled from dynamics simulations using off the shelf hardware.},

  ABSTRACT = {The accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) method has recently been shown to enhance the sampling of biomolecules in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, often by several orders of magnitude. Here, we describe an implementation of the aMD method for the OpenMM application layer that takes full advantage of graphics processing units (GPUs) computing. The aMD method is shown to work in combination with the AMOEBA polarizable force field (AMOEBA-aMD), allowing the simulation of long time-scale events with a polarizable force field. Benchmarks are provided to show that the AMOEBA-aMD method is efficiently implemented and produces accurate results in its standard parametrization. For the BPTI protein, we demonstrate that the protein structure described with AMOEBA remains stable even on the extended time scales accessed at high levels of accelerations. For the DNA repair metalloenzyme endonuclease IV, we show that the use of the AMOEBA force field is a significant improvement over fixed charged models for describing the enzyme active-site. The new AMOEBA-aMD method is publicly available (http://wiki.simtk.org/openmm/VirtualRepository) and promises to be interesting for studying complex systems that can benefit from both the use of a polarizable force field and enhanced sampling.},

  ABSTRACT = {The interactions among associating (macro)molecules are dynamic, which adds to the complexity of molecular recognition. While ligand flexibility is well accounted for in computational drug design, the effective inclusion of receptor flexibility remains an important challenge. The relaxed complex scheme (RCS) is a promising computational methodology that combines the advantages of docking algorithms with dynamic structural information provided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, therefore explicitly accounting for the flexibility of both the receptor and the docked ligands. Here, we briefly review the RCS and discuss new extensions and improvements of this methodology in the context of ligand binding to two example targets: kinetoplastid RNA editing ligase 1 and the W191G cavity mutant of cytochrome c peroxidase. The RCS improvements include its extension to virtual screening, more rigorous characterization of local and global binding effects, and methods to improve its computational efficiency by reducing the receptor ensemble to a representative set of configurations. The choice of receptor ensemble, its influence on the predictive power of RCS, and the current limitations for an accurate treatment of the solvent contributions are also briefly discussed. Finally, we outline potential methodological improvements that we anticipate will assist future development.},

  ABSTRACT = {Community network analysis derived from molecular dynamics simulations is used to identify and compare the signaling pathways in a bacterial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS):tRNA(Glu) and an archaeal leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS):tRNA(Leu) complex. Although the 2 class I synthetases have remarkably different interactions with their cognate tRNAs, the allosteric networks for charging tRNA with the correct amino acid display considerable similarities. A dynamic contact map defines the edges connecting nodes (amino acids and nucleotides) in the physical network whose overall topology is presented as a network of communities, local substructures that are highly intraconnected, but loosely interconnected. Whereas nodes within a single community can communicate through many alternate pathways, the communication between monomers in different communities has to take place through a smaller number of critical edges or interactions. Consistent with this analysis, there are a large number of suboptimal paths that can be used for communication between the identity elements on the tRNAs and the catalytic site in the aaRS:tRNA complexes. Residues and nucleotides in the majority of pathways for intercommunity signal transmission are evolutionarily conserved and are predicted to be important for allosteric signaling. The same monomers are also found in a majority of the suboptimal paths. Modifying these residues or nucleotides has a large effect on the communication pathways in the protein:RNA complex consistent with kinetic data.},

  ABSTRACT = {The serine protease $\alpha$-thrombin is a dual-action protein that mediates the blood-clotting cascade. Thrombin alone is a procoagulant, cleaving fibrinogen to make the fibrin clot, but the thrombin-thrombomodulin (TM) complex initiates the anticoagulant pathway by cleaving protein C. A TM fragment consisting of only the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains (TM56) is sufficient to bind thrombin, but the presence of the fourth EGF-like domain (TM456) is critical to induce the anticoagulant activity of thrombin. Crystallography of the thrombin-TM456 complex revealed no significant structural changes in thrombin, suggesting that TM4 may only provide a scaffold for optimal alignment of protein C for its cleavage by thrombin. However, a variety of experimental data have suggested that the presence of TM4 may affect the dynamic properties of the active site loops. In the present work, we have used both conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics simulation to study the structural dynamic properties of thrombin, thrombin:TM56, and thrombin:TM456 across a broad range of time scales. Two distinct yet interrelated allosteric pathways are identified that mediate both the pro- and anticoagulant activities of thrombin. One allosteric pathway, which is present in both thrombin:TM56 and thrombin:TM456, directly links the TM5 domain to the thrombin active site. The other allosteric pathway, which is only present on slow time scales in the presence of the TM4 domain, involves an extended network of correlated motions linking the TM4 and TM5 domains and the active site loops of thrombin.},

My text: Gasper et al. performed a similar analysis of $\alpha$-thrombin in 2012.

Measures of pairwise mutual information, together with the Girvan-Newmann algorithm, were again used to identify the influence of an allosteric modulator on community formation and intercommunication. Ultimately, their results suggests that $\alpha$-thrombin may have two allosteric pathways. One of these pathways occurs on slower time scales that might not have been accessible were it not for the AMD.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allosteric regulation in biological systems is of considerable interest given the vast number of proteins that exhibit such behavior. Network models obtained from molecular dynamics simulations have been shown to be powerful tools for the analysis of allostery. In this work, different coarse-grain residue representations (nodes) are used together with a dynamical network model to investigate models of allosteric regulation. This model assumes that allosteric signals are dependent on positional correlations of protein substituents, as determined through molecular dynamics simulations, and uses correlated motion to generate a signaling weight between two given nodes. We examine four types of network models using different node representations in Cartesian coordinates: the (i) residue alpha-carbons, (ii) sidechain center of mass, (iii) backbone center of mass, and the entire (iv) residue center of mass. All correlations are filtered by a dynamic contact map that defines the allowable interactions between nodes based on physical proximity. We apply the four models to imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS), which provides a well-studied experimental framework in which allosteric communication is known to persist across disparate protein domains (e.g. a protein dimer interface). IGPS is modeled as a network of nodes and weighted edges. Optimal allosteric pathways are traced using the Floyd Warshall algorithm for weighted networks, and community analysis (a form of hierarchical clustering) is performed using the Girvan-Newman algorithm. Our results show that dynamical information encoded in the residue center of mass must be included in order to detect residues that are experimentally known to play a role in allosteric communication for IGPS. More broadly, this new method may be useful for predicting pathways of allosteric communication for any biomolecular system in atomic detail.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allostery describes altered protein function at one site due to a perturbation at another site. One mechanism of allostery involves correlated motions, which can occur even in the absence of substantial conformational change. We present a novel method, "MutInf", to identify statistically significant correlated motions from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach analyzes both backbone and sidechain motions using internal coordinates to account for the gear-like twists that can take place even in the absence of the large conformational changes typical of traditional allosteric proteins. We quantify correlated motions using a mutual information metric, which we extend to incorporate data from multiple short simulations and to filter out correlations that are not statistically significant. Applying our approach to uncover mechanisms of cooperative small molecule binding in human interleukin-2, we identify clusters of correlated residues from 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, two of the clusters with the strongest correlations highlight known cooperative small-molecule binding sites and show substantial correlations between these sites. These cooperative binding sites on interleukin-2 are correlated not only through the hydrophobic core of the protein but also through a dynamic polar network of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Since this approach identifies correlated conformations in an unbiased, statistically robust manner, it should be a useful tool for finding novel or "orphan" allosteric sites in proteins of biological and therapeutic importance.},

MutInf is unique in that it uses an internal coordinate scheme. Rather than considering the 3D coordinates of residue atoms directly, correlated motions are quantified using a mutual information metric derived from residue torsion angles. This approach makes MutInf particularly well suited for the study of allosteric signals transmitted through gear-like correlated motions between side-chain rotomers. Using multiple short simulations, the authors were able to identify statistically significant motions. Applying the technique to interleukin-2 provided a viable theory of allosteric transmission involving a population-shift-mediated signal transmitted between the allosteric and orthosteric pockets via a greasy core.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a thermodynamical approach to identify changes in macromolecular structure and dynamics in response to perturbations such as mutations or ligand binding, using an expansion of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence that connects local population shifts in torsion angles to changes in the free energy landscape of the protein. While the Kullback-Leibler Divergence is a known formula from information theory, the novelty and power of our implementation lies in its formal developments, connection to thermodynamics, statistical filtering, ease of visualization of results, and extendability by adding higher-order terms. We present a formal derivation of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence expansion and then apply our method at a first-order approximation to molecular dynamics simulations of four protein systems where ligand binding or pH titration is known to cause an effect at a distant site. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental measurements of local changes in structure or dynamics, such as NMR chemical shift perturbations and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The approach produces easy-to-analyze results with low background, and as such has the potential to become a routine analysis when molecular dynamics simulations in two or more conditions are available. Our method is implemented in the MutInf code package and is available on the SimTK website at https://simtk.org/home/mutinf.},

  ABSTRACT = {Escherichia coli NikR is a homotetrameric Ni 2+- and DNA-binding protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor of the NikABCDE nickel permease. The protein is composed of two distinct domains. The N-terminal 50 amino acids of each chain forms part of the dimeric ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domains, a well-studied DNA-binding fold. The 83-residue C-terminal nickel-binding domain forms an ACT (aspartokinase, chorismate mutase, and TyrA) fold and contains the tetrameric interface. In this study, we have utilized an equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation in order to explore the conformational dynamics of the NikR tetramer and determine important residue interactions within and between the RHH and ACT domains to gain insight into the effects of Ni 2+ on DNA-binding activity. The molecular simulation data were analyzed using two different correlation measures based on fluctuations in atomic position and noncovalent contacts together with a clustering algorithm to define groups of residues with similar correlation patterns for both types of correlation measure. Based on these analyses, we have defined a series of residue interrelationships that describe an allosteric communication pathway between the Ni 2+- and DNA-binding sites, which are separated by 40????. Several of the residues identified by our analyses have been previously shown experimentally to be important for NikR function. An additional subset of the identified residues structurally connects the experimentally implicated residues and may help coordinate the allosteric communication between the ACT and RHH domains. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  ABSTRACT = {Allostery can occur by way of subtle cooperation among protein residues (e.g., amino acids) even in the absence of large conformational shifts. Dynamical network analysis has been used to model this cooperation, helping to computationally explain how binding to an allosteric site can impact the behavior of a primary site many {å}ngstroms away. Traditionally, computational efforts have focused on the most optimal path of correlated motions leading from the allosteric to the primary active site. We present a program called Weighted Implementation of Suboptimal Paths (WISP) capable of rapidly identifying additional suboptimal pathways that may also play important roles in the transmission of allosteric signals. Aside from providing signal redundancy, suboptimal paths traverse residues that, if disrupted through pharmacological or mutational means, could modulate the allosteric regulation of important drug targets. To demonstrate the utility of our program, we present a case study describing the allostery of HisH-HisF, an amidotransferase from T. maritima thermotiga.

  ABSTRACT = {Complex networks of interacting residues and microdomains in the structures of biomolecular systems underlie the reliable propagation of information from an input signal, such as the concentration of a ligand, to sites that generate the appropriate output signal, such as enzymatic activity. This information transduction often carries the signal across relatively large distances at the molecular scale in a form of allostery that is essential for the physiological functions performed by biomolecules. While allosteric behaviors have been documented from experiments and computation, the mechanism of this form of allostery proved difficult to identify at the molecular level. Here, we introduce a novel analysis framework, called N-body Information Theory (NbIT) analysis, which is based on information theory and uses measures of configurational entropy in a biomolecular system to identify microdomains and individual residues that act as (i)-channels for long-distance information sharing between functional sites, and (ii)-coordinators that organize dynamics within functional sites. Application of the new method to molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of the occluded state of the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT identifies a channel of allosteric coupling between the functionally important intracellular gate and the substrate binding sites known to modulate it. NbIT analysis is shown also to differentiate residues involved primarily in stabilizing the functional sites, from those that contribute to allosteric couplings between sites. NbIT analysis of MD data thus reveals rigorous mechanistic elements of allostery underlying the dynamics of biomolecular systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {Protein allosteric pathways are investigated in the imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase heterodimer in an effort to elucidate how the effector (PRFAR, N'-[(5'-phosphoribulosyl)formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) activates glutaminase catalysis at a distance of 25 Å from the glutamine-binding site. We apply solution NMR techniques and community analysis of dynamical networks, based on mutual information of correlated protein motions in the active and inactive enzymes. We find evidence that the allosteric pathways in the PRFAR bound enzyme involve conserved residues that correlate motion of the PRFAR binding loop to motion at the protein-protein interface, and ultimately at the glutaminase active site. The imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase bienzyme is an important branch point for the histidine and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways and represents a potential therapeutic target against microbes. The proposed allosteric mechanism and the underlying allosteric pathways provide fundamental insights for the design of new allosteric drugs and/or alternative herbicides.},

  ANNOTATION = {From Duplicate 1 (Allosteric pathways in imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase. - Rivalta, Ivan; Sultan, Mohammad M; Lee, Ning-Shiuan; Manley, Gregory A; Loria, J Patrick; Batista, Victor S) Looked at My text: In 2012, Rivalta et al. studied the allosteric mechanism of PRFAR binding to the imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase heterodimer. Their work was unique in that it combined both solution NMR and community network analysis based on MD-derived mutual information. NMR was used to study PRFAR-mediated changes in residue motions in the ms time scale, and multiple MD simulations were used to study more detailed PRFAR-mediated changes in correlated motions. The authors ultimately conclude that PRFAR binding 1) decreases the correlated motions at sideL of the heterodimer and 2) induces conformational changes in sideR that ultimately impact the hydrogen-bond network near the active site.

  ABSTRACT = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate cellular responses to various hormones and neurotransmitters and are important targets for treating a wide spectrum of diseases. Although significant advances have been made in structural studies of GPCRs, details of their activation mechanism remain unclear. The X-ray crystal structure of the M2 muscarinic receptor, a key GPCR that regulates human heart rate and contractile forces of cardiomyocytes, was determined recently in an inactive antagonist-bound state. Here, activation of the M2 receptor is directly observed via accelerated molecular dynamics simulation, in contrast to previous microsecond-timescale conventional molecular dynamics simulations in which the receptor remained inactive. Receptor activation is characterized by formation of a Tyr206(5.58)-Tyr440(7.53) hydrogen bond and ∼6-{Å} outward tilting of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane $\alpha$-helix 6, preceded by relocation of Trp400(6.48) toward Phe195(5.47) and Val199(5.51) and flipping of Tyr430(7.43) away from the ligand-binding cavity. Network analysis reveals that communication in the intracellular domains is greatly weakened during activation of the receptor. Together with the finding that residue motions in the ligand-binding and G-protein-coupling sites of the apo receptor are correlated, this result highlights a dynamic network for allosteric regulation of the M2 receptor activation.},

  ABSTRACT = {A fundamental role of the Hsp90 chaperone in regulating functional activity of diverse protein clients is essential for the integrity of signaling networks. In this work we have combined biophysical simulations of the Hsp90 crystal structures with the protein structure network analysis to characterize the statistical ensemble of allosteric interaction networks and communication pathways in the Hsp90 chaperones. We have found that principal structurally stable communities could be preserved during dynamic changes in the conformational ensemble. The dominant contribution of the inter-domain rigidity to the interaction networks has emerged as a common factor responsible for the thermodynamic stability of the active chaperone form during the ATPase cycle. Structural stability analysis using force constant profiling of the inter-residue fluctuation distances has identified a network of conserved structurally rigid residues that could serve as global mediating sites of allosteric communication. Mapping of the conformational landscape with the network centrality parameters has demonstrated that stable communities and mediating residues may act concertedly with the shifts in the conformational equilibrium and could describe the majority of functionally significant chaperone residues. The network analysis has revealed a relationship between structural stability, global centrality and functional significance of hotspot residues involved in chaperone regulation. We have found that allosteric interactions in the Hsp90 chaperone may be mediated by modules of structurally stable residues that display high betweenness in the global interaction network. The results of this study have suggested that allosteric interactions in the Hsp90 chaperone may operate via a mechanism that combines rapid and efficient communication by a single optimal pathway of structurally rigid residues and more robust signal transmission using an ensemble of suboptimal multiple communication routes. This may be a universal requirement encoded in protein structures to balance the inherent tension between resilience and efficiency of the residue interaction networks.},

  ANNOTATION = {From Duplicate 1 (Computational modeling of allosteric regulation in the hsp90 chaperones: a statistical ensemble analysis of protein structure networks and allosteric communications. - Blacklock, Kristin; Verkhivker, Gennady M) Appears to be community analysis. Good to add. Does your section include elastic network models and normal mode analysis? See refs 75,76, Also, see Feher review. Lots of stuff there that could be rewritten/incorporated into present review. Prioritize that (low-hanging fruit). Text: In 2014, Blacklock and Verkhivker used protein structure network analysis to similarly analyze MD trajectories of the Hsp90 chaperone, in various functional states. Their technique is interesting because it seeks to organize residue nodes into modules or “communities,” i.e. structurally stable residues groups. In their view, allostery is achieved when largely isolated communities of highly interconnected residue nodes (“small-world networks”) engage in long-range interactions. To demonstrate the existence of these communities, they first calculated force constants for each residue, corresponding to the energy cost of residue displacement over the course of the equilibrium simulation. As residues with high force constants are typically rigid, community boundaries (e.g., the boundary between a rigid module and a flexible inter-domain hinge site) often correspond to locations where these constants change abruptly. The “hotspot” regions did in fact correspond to residues known experimentally to be important hinge sites or sites of dimerization.   To further characterize this organization, the authors next used protein structure network analysis to build a network representation of Hsp dynamics. Cross-correlation matrices were calculated from the MD simulations, and residues with high degrees of “centrality” (i.e., the number of interacting residues) and “betweenness” (i.e., the frequency with which a given node lies on along the shortest path in network space between two other nodes) were identified. This analysis ultimately leads the authors to conclude that Hsp allosteric communication is mediated by highly stable central nodes, surrounded by residues with high degrees of betweenness that may “shield” the more critical residues from the random Brownian/thermal motions common to all proteins.},

  ABSTRACT = {An increasing number of structural studies reveal alternative binding sites in protein receptors that become apparent only when an inhibitor binds, and correct prediction of these situations presents a significant challenge to computer-aided drug design efforts. A striking example is provided by recent crystal structures of the p38 MAP kinase, where a 10A movement of the Phe169 side-chain creates a new binding site adjacent to the ATP binding site that is exploited by the diaryl urea inhibitor BIRB796. Here, we show that this binding site can be successfully and repeatedly identified in explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the protein that begin from an unliganded p38 crystal structure. Ligand-docking calculations performed on 5000 different structural snapshots generated during MD indicate that the conformations sampled are often surprisingly competent to bind the inhibitor BIRB796 in the crystallographically correct position and with docked energies that are generally more favorable than those of other positions. Similar docking studies with an ATP-binding site-directed inhibitor suggest that it may be possible to develop hybrid inhibitors that target both the ATP and cryptic binding sites simultaneously. Intriguingly, both inhibitors are occasionally found to dock correctly even with p38's "DFG" motif in the "wrong" conformation and BIRB796 can successfully dock, albeit infrequently, without significant displacement of the Phe169 side-chain; this suggests that the inhibitor might facilitate the latter's conformational change. Finally, two quite different conformations of p38's DFG motif are also sampled for extended periods of time during the simulations; these may provide new opportunities for inhibitor development. The MD simulations reported here, which total 390 ns in length, therefore demonstrate that existing computational methods may be of surprising utility in predicting cryptic binding sites in protein receptors prior to their experimental discovery.},

  ABSTRACT = {Cryptic allosteric sites--transient pockets in a folded protein that are invisible to conventional experiments but can alter enzymatic activity via allosteric communication with the active site--are a promising opportunity for facilitating drug design by greatly expanding the repertoire of available drug targets. Unfortunately, identifying these sites is difficult, typically requiring resource-intensive screening of large libraries of small molecules. Here, we demonstrate that Markov state models built from extensive computer simulations (totaling hundreds of microseconds of dynamics) can identify prospective cryptic sites from the equilibrium fluctuations of three medically relevant proteins--$\beta$-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H--even in the absence of any ligand. As in previous studies, our methods reveal a surprising variety of conformations--including bound-like configurations--that implies a role for conformational selection in ligand binding. Moreover, our analyses lead to a number of unique insights. First, direct comparison of simulations with and without the ligand reveals that there is still an important role for an induced fit during ligand binding to cryptic sites and suggests new conformations for docking. Second, correlations between amino acid sidechains can convey allosteric signals even in the absence of substantial backbone motions. Most importantly, our extensive sampling reveals a multitude of potential cryptic sites--consisting of transient pockets coupled to the active site--even in a single protein. Based on these observations, we propose that cryptic allosteric sites may be even more ubiquitous than previously thought and that our methods should be a valuable means of guiding the search for such sites.},

  ABSTRACT = {The tumour suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. Reactivation of mutant p53 by small molecules is an exciting potential cancer therapy. Although several compounds restore wild-type function to mutant p53, their binding sites and mechanisms of action are elusive. Here computational methods identify a transiently open binding pocket between loop L1 and sheet S3 of the p53 core domain. Mutation of residue Cys124, located at the centre of the pocket, abolishes p53 reactivation of mutant R175H by PRIMA-1, a known reactivation compound. Ensemble-based virtual screening against this newly revealed pocket selects stictic acid as a potential p53 reactivation compound. In human osteosarcoma cells, stictic acid exhibits dose-dependent reactivation of p21 expression for mutant R175H more strongly than does PRIMA-1. These results indicate the L1/S3 pocket as a target for pharmaceutical reactivation of p53 mutants.},

Characteristics of individual transport pathways, including their geometry, physico-chemical properties and dynamics are instrumental for understanding of structure-function relationships of these proteins, for the design of new inhibitors and construction of improved biocatalysts. CAVER is a software tool widely used for the identification and characterization of transport pathways in static macromolecular structures. Herein we present a new version of CAVER enabling automatic analysis of tunnels and channels in large ensembles of protein conformations. CAVER 3.0 implements new algorithms for the calculation and clustering of pathways. A trajectory from a molecular dynamics simulation serves as the typical input, while detailed characteristics and summary statistics of the time evolution of individual pathways are provided in the outputs. To illustrate the capabilities of CAVER 3.0, the tool was applied for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulation of the microbial enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA. CAVER 3.0 safely identified and reliably estimated the importance of all previously published DhaA tunnels, including the tunnels closed in DhaA crystal structures. Obtained results clearly demonstrate that analysis of molecular dynamics simulation is essential for the estimation of pathway characteristics and elucidation of the structural basis of the tunnel gating. CAVER 3.0 paves the way for the study of important biochemical phenomena in the area of molecular transport, molecular recognition and enzymatic catalysis.

  ABSTRACT = {A new pocket detection protocol successfully identified transient pockets on the protein surfaces of BCL-XL, IL-2, and MDM2. Because the native inhibitor binding pocket was absent or only partly detectable in the unbound proteins, these crystal structures were used as starting points for 10 ns long molecular dynamics simulations. Trajectory snapshots were scanned for cavities on the protein surface using the program PASS. The detected cavities were clustered to determine several distinct transient pockets. They all opened within 2.5 ps, and most of them appeared multiple times. All three systems gave similar results overall. At the native binding site, pockets of similar size compared with a known inhibitor bound could be observed for all three systems. AutoDock could successfully place inhibitor molecules into these transient pockets with less than 2 A rms deviation from their crystal structures, suggesting this protocol as a viable tool to identify transient ligand binding pockets on protein surfaces.},

  ABSTRACT = {PASS (Putative Active Sites with Spheres) is a simple computational tool that uses geometry to characterize regions of buried volume in proteins and to identify positions likely to represent binding sites based upon the size, shape, and burial extent of these volumes. Its utility as a predictive tool for binding site identification is tested by predicting known binding sites of proteins in the PDB using both complexed macromolecules and their corresponding apoprotein structures. The results indicate that PASS can serve as a front-end to fast docking. The main utility of PASS lies in the fact that it can analyze a moderate-size protein (approximately 30 kDa) in under 20 s, which makes it suitable for interactive molecular modeling, protein database analysis, and aggressive virtual screening efforts. As a modeling tool, PASS (i) rapidly identifies favorable regions of the protein surface, (ii) simplifies visualization of residues modulating binding in these regions, and (iii) provides a means of directly visualizing buried volume, which is often inferred indirectly from curvature in a surface representation. PASS produces output in the form of standard PDB files, which are suitable for any modeling package, and provides script files to simplify visualization in Cerius2, InsightII, MOE, Quanta, RasMol, and Sybyl. PASS is freely available to all.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Virtual screening methods start to be well established as effective approaches to identify hits, candidates and leads for drug discovery research. Among those, structure based virtual screening (SBVS) approaches aim at docking collections of small compounds in the target structure to identify potent compounds. For SBVS, the identification of candidate pockets in protein structures is a key feature, and the recent years have seen increasing interest in developing methods for pocket and cavity detection on protein surfaces. RESULTS: Fpocket is an open source pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres built on top of the publicly available package Qhull. The modular source code is organised around a central library of functions, a basis for three main programs: (i) Fpocket, to perform pocket identification, (ii) Tpocket, to organise pocket detection benchmarking on a set of known protein-ligand complexes, and (iii) Dpocket, to collect pocket descriptor values on a set of proteins. Fpocket is written in the C programming language, which makes it a platform well suited for the scientific community willing to develop new scoring functions and extract various pocket descriptors on a large scale level. Fpocket 1.0, relying on a simple scoring function, is able to detect 94{\%} and 92{\%} of the pockets within the best three ranked pockets from the holo and apo proteins respectively, outperforming the standards of the field, while being faster. CONCLUSION: Fpocket provides a rapid, open source and stable basis for further developments related to protein pocket detection, efficient pocket descriptor extraction, or drugablity prediction purposes.

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: A variety of pocket detection algorithms are now freely or commercially available to the scientific community for the analysis of static protein structures. However, since proteins are dynamic entities, enhancing the capabilities of these programs for the straightforward detection and characterization of cavities taking into account protein conformational ensembles should be valuable for capturing the plasticity of pockets, and therefore allow gaining insight into structure-function relationships. RESULTS: This article describes a new method, called MDpocket, providing a fast, free and open-source tool for tracking small molecule binding sites and gas migration pathways on molecular dynamics (MDs) trajectories or other conformational ensembles. MDpocket is based on the fpocket cavity detection algorithm and a valuable contribution to existing analysis tools. The capabilities of MDpocket are illustrated for three relevant cases: (i) the detection of transient subpockets using an ensemble of crystal structures of HSP90; (ii) the detection of known xenon binding sites and migration pathways in myoglobin; and (iii) the identification of suitable pockets for molecular docking in P38 Map kinase. AVAILABILITY: MDpocket is free and open-source software and can be downloaded at http://fpocket.sourceforge.net.

  ABSTRACT = {Structure-based drug design seeks to exploit the structure of protein-ligand or protein-protein binding sites, but the site is not always known at the outset. Even when the site is known, the researcher may wish to identify alternative prospective binding sites that may result in different biological effects or new class of compounds. It is also vital in lead optimization to clearly understand the degree to which known binders or docking hits satisfy or violate complementarity to the receptor. SiteMap is a new technique for identifying potential binding sites and for predicting their druggability in lead-discovery applications and for characterizing binding sites and critically assessing prospective ligands in lead-optimization applications. In large-scale validation tests, SiteMap correctly identifies the known binding site in > 96{\%} of the cases, with best results (> 98{\%}) coming for sites that bind ligands tightly. It also accurately distinguishes between sites that bind ligands and sites that don't. In binding-site analysis, SiteMap provides a wealth of quantitative and graphical information that can help guide efforts to modify ligand structure to enhance potency or improve physical properties. These attributes allow SiteMap to nicely complement techniques such as docking and computational lead optimization in structure-base drug design.},

  ABSTRACT = {Identification and characterization of binding sites is key in the process of structure-based drug design. In some cases there may not be any information about the binding site for a target of interest. In other cases, a putative binding site has been identified by computational or experimental means, but the druggability of the target is not known. Even when a site for a given target is known, it may be desirable to find additional sites whose targeting could produce a desired biological response. A new program, called SiteMap, is presented for identifying and analyzing binding sites and for predicting target druggability. In a large-scale validation, SiteMap correctly identifies the known binding site as the top-ranked site in 86{\%} of the cases, with best results (>98{\%}) coming for sites that bind ligands with subnanomolar affinity. In addition, a modified version of the score employed for binding-site identification allows SiteMap to accurately classify the druggability of proteins as measured by their ability to bind passively absorbed small molecules tightly. In characterizing binding sites, SiteMap provides quantitative and graphical information that can help guide efforts to critically assess virtual hits in a lead-discovery application or to modify ligand structure to enhance potency or improve physical properties in a lead-optimization context.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: The binding sites of proteins generally contain smaller regions that provide major contributions to the binding free energy and hence are the prime targets in drug design. Screening libraries of fragment-sized compounds by NMR or X-ray crystallography demonstrates that such 'hot spot' regions bind a large variety of small organic molecules, and that a relatively high 'hit rate' is predictive of target sites that are likely to bind drug-like ligands with high affinity. Our goal is to determine the 'hot spots' computationally rather than experimentally. RESULTS: We have developed the FTMAP algorithm that performs global search of the entire protein surface for regions that bind a number of small organic probe molecules. The search is based on the extremely efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation approach which can sample billions of probe positions on dense translational and rotational grids, but can use only sums of correlation functions for scoring and hence is generally restricted to very simple energy expressions. The novelty of FTMAP is that we were able to incorporate and represent on grids a detailed energy expression, resulting in a very accurate identification of low-energy probe clusters. Overlapping clusters of different probes are defined as consensus sites (CSs). We show that the largest CS is generally located at the most important subsite of the protein binding site, and the nearby smaller CSs identify other important subsites. Mapping results are presented for elastase whose structure has been solved in aqueous solutions of eight organic solvents, and we show that FTMAP provides very similar information. The second application is to renin, a long-standing pharmaceutical target for the treatment of hypertension, and we show that the major CSs trace out the shape of the first approved renin inhibitor, aliskiren. AVAILABILITY: FTMAP is available as a server at http://ftmap.bu.edu/.},

Herein, some recent progresses and developments of the computational analysis of pockets have been covered. Also, the pockets at the protein-protein interfaces (PPI) have been considered to further explore the pocket space for drug discovery. We have presented two case studies targeting the kinetic pockets generated by normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics method, respectively, in which we focus upon incorporating the pocket flexibility into the two-dimensional virtual screening with both affinity and specificity. We applied the specificity and affinity (SPA) score to quantitatively estimate affinity and evaluate specificity using the intrinsic specificity ratio (ISR) as a quantitative criterion. In one of two cases, we also included some applications of pockets located at the dimer interfaces to emphasize the role of PPI in drug discovery. This review will attempt to summarize the current status of this pocket issue and will present some prospective avenues of further inquiry.},

  ABSTRACT = {One of the simplest ways to predict ligand binding sites is to identify pocket-shaped regions on the protein surface. Many programs have already been proposed to identify these pocket regions. Examination of their algorithms revealed that a pocket intrinsically has two arbitrary properties, "size" and "depth". We proposed a new definition for pockets using two explicit adjustable parameters that correspond to these two arbitrary properties. A pocket region is defined as a space into which a small probe can enter, but a large probe cannot. The radii of small and large probe spheres are the two parameters that correspond to the "size" and "depth" of the pockets, respectively. These values can be adjusted individual putative ligand molecule. To determine the optimal value of the large probe spheres radius, we generated pockets for thousands of protein structures in the database, using several size of large probe spheres, examined the correspondence of these pockets with known binding site positions. A new measure of shallowness, a minimum inaccessible radius, R(inaccess), indicated that binding sites of coenzymes are very deep, while those for adenine/guanine mononucleotide have only medium shallowness and those for short peptides and oligosaccharides are shallow. The optimal radius of large probe spheres was 3-4 A for the coenzymes, 4 A for adenine/guanine mononucleotides, and 5 A or more for peptides/oligosaccharides. Comparison of our program with two other popular pocket-finding programs showed that our program had a higher performance of detecting binding pockets, although it required more computational time.},

  ABSTRACT = {The biological function of a protein typically depends on the structure of specific binding sites. These sites are located at the surface of the protein molecule and are determined by geometrical arrangements and physico-chemical properties of tens of non-hydrogen atoms. In this paper we describe a new algorithm called APROPOS, based purely on geometric criteria for identifying such binding sites using atomic co-ordinates. For the description of the protein shape we use an alpha-shape algorithm which generates a whole family of shapes with different levels of detail. Comparing shapes of different resolution we find cavities on the surface of the protein responsible for ligand binding. The algorithm correctly locates more than 95{\%} of all binding sites for ligands and prosthetic groups of molecular mass between about 100 and 2000 Da in a representative set of proteins. Only in very few proteins does the method find binding sites of single ions outside the active site of enzymes. With one exception, we observe that interfaces between subunits show different geometric features compared to binding sites of ligands. Our results clearly support the view that protein-protein interactions occur between flat areas of protein surface whereas specific interactions of smaller ligands take place in pockets in the surface.},

  ABSTRACT = {Identification and size characterization of surface pockets and occluded cavities are initial steps in protein structure-based ligand design. A new program, CAST, for automatically locating and measuring protein pockets and cavities, is based on precise computational geometry methods, including alpha shape and discrete flow theory. CAST identifies and measures pockets and pocket mouth openings, as well as cavities. The program specifies the atoms lining pockets, pocket openings, and buried cavities; the volume and area of pockets and cavities; and the area and circumference of mouth openings. CAST analysis of over 100 proteins has been carried out; proteins examined include a set of 51 monomeric enzyme-ligand structures, several elastase-inhibitor complexes, the FK506 binding protein, 30 HIV-1 protease-inhibitor complexes, and a number of small and large protein inhibitors. Medium-sized globular proteins typically have 10-20 pockets/cavities. Most often, binding sites are pockets with 1-2 mouth openings; much less frequently they are cavities. Ligand binding pockets vary widely in size, most within the range 10(2)-10(3)A3. Statistical analysis reveals that the number of pockets and cavities is correlated with protein size, but there is no correlation between the size of the protein and the size of binding sites. Most frequently, the largest pocket/cavity is the active site, but there are a number of instructive exceptions. Ligand volume and binding site volume are somewhat correlated when binding site volume is < or =700 A3, but the ligand seldom occupies the entire site. Auxiliary pockets near the active site have been suggested as additional binding surface for designed ligands (Mattos C et al., 1994, Nat Struct Biol 1:55-58). Analysis of elastase-inhibitor complexes suggests that CAST can identify ancillary pockets suitable for recruitment in ligand design strategies. Analysis of the FK506 binding protein, and of compounds developed in SAR by NMR (Shuker SB et al., 1996, Science 274:1531-1534), indicates that CAST pocket computation may provide a priori identification of target proteins for linked-fragment design. CAST analysis of 30 HIV-1 protease-inhibitor complexes shows that the flexible active site pocket can vary over a range of 853-1,566 A3, and that there are two pockets near or adjoining the active site that may be recruited for ligand design.},

  ABSTRACT = {Detection of pockets on protein surfaces is an important step toward finding the binding sites of small molecules. In a previous study, we defined a pocket as a space into which a small spherical probe can enter, but a large probe cannot. The radius of the large probes corresponds to the shallowness of pockets. We showed that each type of binding molecule has a characteristic shallowness distribution. In this study, we introduced fundamental changes to our previous algorithm by using a 3D grid representation of proteins and probes, and the theory of mathematical morphology. We invented an efficient algorithm for calculating deep and shallow pockets (multiscale pockets) simultaneously, using several different sizes of spherical probes (multiscale probes). We implemented our algorithm as a new program, ghecom (grid-based HECOMi finder). The statistics of calculated pockets for the structural dataset showed that our program had a higher performance of detecting binding pockets, than four other popular pocket-finding programs proposed previously. The ghecom also calculates the shallowness of binding ligands, R(inaccess) (minimum radius of inaccessible spherical probes) that can be obtained from the multiscale molecular volume. We showed that each part of the binding molecule had a bias toward a specific range of shallowness. These findings will be useful for predicting the types of molecules that will be most likely to bind putative binding pockets, as well as the configurations of binding molecules. The program ghecom is available through the Web server (http://biunit.naist.jp/ghecom).},

  ABSTRACT = {LIGSITE is a new program for the automatic and time-efficient detection of pockets on the surface of proteins that may act as binding sites for small molecule ligands. Pockets are identified with a series of simple operations on a cubic grid. Using a set of receptor-ligand complexes we show that LIGSITE is able to identify the binding sites of small molecule ligands with high precision. The main advantage of LIGSITE is its speed. Typical search times are in the range of 5 to 20 s for medium-sized proteins. LIGSITE is therefore well suited for identification of pockets in large sets of proteins (e.g., protein families) for comparative studies. For graphical display LIGSITE produces VRML representations of the protein-ligand complex and the binding site for display with a VRML viewer such as WebSpace from SGI.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Identifying pockets on protein surfaces is of great importance for many structure-based drug design applications and protein-ligand docking algorithms. Over the last ten years, many geometric methods for the prediction of ligand-binding sites have been developed. RESULTS: We present LIGSITEcsc, an extension and implementation of the LIGSITE algorithm. LIGSITEcsc is based on the notion of surface-solvent-surface events and the degree of conservation of the involved surface residues. We compare our algorithm to four other approaches, LIGSITE, CAST, PASS, and SURFNET, and evaluate all on a dataset of 48 unbound/bound structures and 210 bound-structures. LIGSITEcsc performs slightly better than the other tools and achieves a success rate of 71{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of the Connolly surface leads to slight improvements, the prediction re-ranking by conservation to significant improvements of the binding site predictions.

  ABSTRACT = {A new interactive graphics program is described that provides a quick and simple procedure for identifying, displaying, and manipulating the indentations, cavities, or holes in a known protein structure. These regions are defined as, e.g., the xo, yo, zo values at which a test sphere of radius r can be placed without touching the centers of any protein atoms, subject to the condition that there is some x < xo and some x > xo where the sphere does touch the protein atoms. The surfaces of these pockets are modeled using a modification of the marching cubes algorithm. This modification provides identification of each closed surface so that by "clicking" on any line of the surface, the entire surface can be selected. The surface can be displayed either as a line grid or as a solid surface. After the desired "pocket" has been selected, the amino acid residues and atoms that surround this pocket can be selected and displayed. The protein database that is input can have more than one protein "segment," allowing identification of the pockets at the interface between proteins. The use of the program is illustrated with several specific examples. The program is written in C and requires Silicon Graphics graphics routines.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Identification and evaluation of surface binding-pockets and occluded cavities are initial steps in protein structure-based drug design. Characterizing the active site's shape as well as the distribution of surrounding residues plays an important role for a variety of applications such as automated ligand docking or in situ modeling. Comparing the shape similarity of binding site geometries of related proteins provides further insights into the mechanisms of ligand binding. RESULTS: We present PocketPicker, an automated grid-based technique for the prediction of protein binding pockets that specifies the shape of a potential binding-site with regard to its buriedness. The method was applied to a representative set of protein-ligand complexes and their corresponding apo-protein structures to evaluate the quality of binding-site predictions. The performance of the pocket detection routine was compared to results achieved with the existing methods CAST, LIGSITE, LIGSITE(cs), PASS and SURFNET. Success rates PocketPicker were comparable to those of LIGSITE(cs) and outperformed the other tools. We introduce a descriptor that translates the arrangement of grid points delineating a detected binding-site into a correlation vector. We show that this shape descriptor is suited for comparative analyses of similar binding-site geometry by examining induced-fit phenomena in aldose reductase. This new method uses information derived from calculations of the buriedness of potential binding-sites. CONCLUSION: The pocket prediction routine of PocketPicker is a useful tool for identification of potential protein binding-pockets. It produces a convenient representation of binding-site shapes including an intuitive description of their accessibility. The shape-descriptor for automated classification of binding-site geometries can be used as an additional tool complementing elaborate manual inspections.},

  ABSTRACT = {We developed a new computational algorithm for the accurate identification of ligand binding envelopes rather than surface binding sites. We performed a large scale classification of the identified envelopes according to their shape and physicochemical properties. The predicting algorithm, called PocketFinder, uses a transformation of the Lennard-Jones potential calculated from a three-dimensional protein structure and does not require any knowledge about a potential ligand molecule. We validated this algorithm using two systematically collected data sets of ligand binding pockets from complexed (bound) and uncomplexed (apo) structures from the Protein Data Bank, 5616 and 11,510, respectively. As many as 96.8{\%} of experimental binding sites were predicted at better than 50{\%} overlap level. Furthermore 95.0{\%} of the asserted sites from the apo receptors were predicted at the same level. We demonstrate that conformational differences between the apo and bound pockets do not dramatically affect the prediction results. The algorithm can be used to predict ligand binding pockets of uncharacterized protein structures, suggest new allosteric pockets, evaluate feasibility of protein-protein interaction inhibition, and prioritize molecular targets. Finally the data base of the known and predicted binding pockets for the human proteome structures, the human pocketome, was collected and classified. The pocketome can be used for rapid evaluation of possible binding partners of a given chemical compound.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Identifying the location of ligand binding sites on a protein is of fundamental importance for a range of applications including molecular docking, de novo drug design and structural identification and comparison of functional sites. Here, we describe a new method of ligand binding site prediction called Q-SiteFinder. It uses the interaction energy between the protein and a simple van der Waals probe to locate energetically favourable binding sites. Energetically favourable probe sites are clustered according to their spatial proximity and clusters are then ranked according to the sum of interaction energies for sites within each cluster. RESULTS: There is at least one successful prediction in the top three predicted sites in 90{\%} of proteins tested when using Q-SiteFinder. This success rate is higher than that of a commonly used pocket detection algorithm (Pocket-Finder) which uses geometric criteria. Additionally, Q-SiteFinder is twice as effective as Pocket-Finder in generating predicted sites that map accurately onto ligand coordinates. It also generates predicted sites with the lowest average volumes of the methods examined in this study. Unlike pocket detection, the volumes of the predicted sites appear to show relatively low dependence on protein volume and are similar in volume to the ligands they contain. Restricting the size of the pocket is important for reducing the search space required for docking and de novo drug design or site comparison. The method can be applied in structural genomics studies where protein binding sites remain uncharacterized since the 86{\%} success rate for unbound proteins appears to be only slightly lower than that of ligand-bound proteins.

Since its release in 2011, the POVME (POcket Volume MEasurer) algorithm has been widely adopted as a simple-to-use tool for measuring and characterizing pocket volumes and shapes. We here present POVME 2.0, which is an order of magnitude faster, has improved accuracy, includes a graphical user interface, and can produce volumetric density maps for improved pocket analysis. To demonstrate the utility of the algorithm, we use it to analyze the binding pocket of RNA editing ligase 1 from the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the etiological agent of African sleeping sickness. The POVME analysis characterizes the full dynamics of a potentially druggable transient binding pocket and so may guide future antitrypanosomal drug-discovery efforts. We are hopeful that this new version will be a useful tool for the computational- and medicinal-chemist community.},

  ABSTRACT = {The detection of ligand-binding sites is often the starting point for protein function identification and drug discovery. Because of inaccuracies in predicted protein structures, extant binding pocket-detection methods are limited to experimentally solved structures. Here, FINDSITE, a method for ligand-binding site prediction and functional annotation based on binding-site similarity across groups of weakly homologous template structures identified from threading, is described. For crystal structures, considering a cutoff distance of 4 A as the hit criterion, the success rate is 70.9{\%} for identifying the best of top five predicted ligand-binding sites with a ranking accuracy of 76.0{\%}. Both high prediction accuracy and ability to correctly rank identified binding sites are sustained when approximate protein models (<35{\%} sequence identity to the closest template structure) are used, showing a 67.3{\%} success rate with 75.5{\%} ranking accuracy. In practice, FINDSITE tolerates structural inaccuracies in protein models up to a rmsd from the crystal structure of 8-10 A. This is because analysis of weakly homologous protein models reveals that about half have a rmsd from the native binding site <2 A. Furthermore, the chemical properties of template-bound ligands can be used to select ligand templates associated with the binding site. In most cases, FINDSITE can accurately assign a molecular function to the protein model.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: The prediction of ligand-binding residues or catalytically active residues of a protein may give important hints that can guide further genetic or biochemical studies. Existing sequence-based prediction methods mostly rank residue positions by evolutionary conservation calculated from a multiple sequence alignment of homologs. A problem hampering more wide-spread application of these methods is the low per-residue precision, which at 20{\%} sensitivity is around 35{\%} for ligand-binding residues and 20{\%} for catalytic residues. RESULTS: We combine information from the conservation at each site, its amino acid distribution, as well as its predicted secondary structure (ss) and relative solvent accessibility (rsa). First, we measure conservation by how much the amino acid distribution at each site differs from the distribution expected for the predicted ss and rsa states. Second, we include the conservation of neighboring residues in a weighted linear score by analytically optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the total score. Third, we use conditional probability density estimation to calculate the probability of each site to be functional given its conservation, the observed amino acid distribution, and the predicted ss and rsa states. We have constructed two large data sets, one based on the Catalytic Site Atlas and the other on PDB SITE records, to benchmark methods for predicting functional residues. The new method FRcons predicts ligand-binding and catalytic residues with higher precision than alternative methods over the entire sensitivity range, reaching 50{\%} and 40{\%} precision at 20{\%} sensitivity, respectively.

  ABSTRACT = {Identifying a protein's functional sites is an important step towards characterizing its molecular function. Numerous structure- and sequence-based methods have been developed for this problem. Here we introduce ConCavity, a small molecule binding site prediction algorithm that integrates evolutionary sequence conservation estimates with structure-based methods for identifying protein surface cavities. In large-scale testing on a diverse set of single- and multi-chain protein structures, we show that ConCavity substantially outperforms existing methods for identifying both 3D ligand binding pockets and individual ligand binding residues. As part of our testing, we perform one of the first direct comparisons of conservation-based and structure-based methods. We find that the two approaches provide largely complementary information, which can be combined to improve upon either approach alone. We also demonstrate that ConCavity has state-of-the-art performance in predicting catalytic sites and drug binding pockets. Overall, the algorithms and analysis presented here significantly improve our ability to identify ligand binding sites and further advance our understanding of the relationship between evolutionary sequence conservation and structural and functional attributes of proteins. Data, source code, and prediction visualizations are available on the ConCavity web site (http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/concavity/).},

  ABSTRACT = {Despite the growing number of examples of small-molecule inhibitors that disrupt protein-protein interactions (PPIs), the origin of druggability of such targets is poorly understood. To identify druggable sites in protein-protein interfaces we combine computational solvent mapping, which explores the protein surface using a variety of small "probe" molecules, with a conformer generator to account for side-chain flexibility. Applications to unliganded structures of 15 PPI target proteins show that the druggable sites comprise a cluster of binding hot spots, distinguishable from other regions of the protein due to their concave topology combined with a pattern of hydrophobic and polar functionality. This combination of properties confers on the hot spots a tendency to bind organic species possessing some polar groups decorating largely hydrophobic scaffolds. Thus, druggable sites at PPI are not simply sites that are complementary to particular organic functionality, but rather possess a general tendency to bind organic compounds with a variety of structures, including key side chains of the partner protein. Results also highlight the importance of conformational adaptivity at the binding site to allow the hot spots to expand to accommodate a ligand of drug-like dimensions. The critical components of this adaptivity are largely local, involving primarily low energy side-chain motions within 6 Å of a hot spot. The structural and physicochemical signature of druggable sites at PPI interfaces is sufficiently robust to be detectable from the structure of the unliganded protein, even when substantial conformational adaptation is required for optimal ligand binding.},

  ABSTRACT = {FTMap is a computational mapping server that identifies binding hot spots of macromolecules-i.e., regions of the surface with major contributions to the ligand-binding free energy. To use FTMap, users submit a protein, DNA or RNA structure in PDB (Protein Data Bank) format. FTMap samples billions of positions of small organic molecules used as probes, and it scores the probe poses using a detailed energy expression. Regions that bind clusters of multiple probe types identify the binding hot spots in good agreement with experimental data. FTMap serves as the basis for other servers, namely FTSite, which is used to predict ligand-binding sites, FTFlex, which is used to account for side chain flexibility, FTMap/param, used to parameterize additional probes and FTDyn, for mapping ensembles of protein structures. Applications include determining the druggability of proteins, identifying ligand moieties that are most important for binding, finding the most bound-like conformation in ensembles of unliganded protein structures and providing input for fragment-based drug design. FTMap is more accurate than classical mapping methods such as GRID and MCSS, and it is much faster than the more-recent approaches to protein mapping based on mixed molecular dynamics.

From 1,000 to 5,000 copies of a functional group are randomly placed in the site and subjected to simultaneous energy minimization and/or quenched molecular dynamics. The resulting functionality maps of a protein receptor site, which can take account of its flexibility, can be used for the analysis of protein ligand interactions and rational drug design. Application of the method to the sialic acid binding site of the influenza coat protein, hemagglutinin, yields functional group minima that correspond with those of the ligand in a cocrystal structure.},

An overview is given of the methods currently used to locate and characterize ligand binding sites on protein surfaces, with focus on a novel approach: multiple solvent crystal structures (MSCS). In this method, the X-ray crystal structure of the target protein is solved in a variety of organic solvents. Each type of solvent molecule serves as a probe for complementary binding sites on the protein. The probe distribution on the protein surface allows the location of binding sites and the characterization of the potential ligand interactions within these sites. General aspects of the application of the MSCS method to porcine pancreatic elastase is discussed, and comparison of the results with those from X-ray crystal structures of elastase/inhibitor complexes is used to illustrate the potential of the method in aiding the process of rational drug design.},

  ABSTRACT = {Binding hot spots, protein sites with high-binding affinity, can be identified using X-ray crystallography or NMR by screening libraries of small organic molecules that tend to cluster at such regions. FTMAP, a direct computational analog of the experimental screening approaches, globally samples the surface of a target protein using small organic molecules as probes, finds favorable positions, clusters the conformations and ranks the clusters on the basis of the average energy. The regions that bind several probe clusters predict the binding hot spots, in good agreement with experimental results. Small molecules discovered by fragment-based approaches to drug design also bind at the hot spot regions. To identify such molecules and their most likely bound positions, we extend the functionality of FTMAP (http://ftmap.bu.edu/param) to accept any small molecule as an additional probe. In its updated form, FTMAP identifies the hot spots based on a standard set of probes, and for each additional probe shows representative structures of nearby low energy clusters. This approach helps to predict bound poses of the user-selected molecules, detects if a compound is not likely to bind in the hot spot region, and provides input for the design of larger ligands.},

  ABSTRACT = {To address the problem of specificity in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) drug discovery, there has been tremendous recent interest in allosteric drugs that bind at sites topographically distinct from the orthosteric site. Unfortunately, structure-based drug design of allosteric GPCR ligands has been frustrated by the paucity of structural data for allosteric binding sites, making a strong case for predictive computational methods. In this work, we map the surfaces of the beta1 (beta1AR) and beta2 (beta2AR) adrenergic receptor structures to detect a series of five potentially druggable allosteric sites. We employ the FTMAP algorithm to identify 'hot spots' with affinity for a variety of organic probe molecules corresponding to drug fragments. Our work is distinguished by an ensemble-based approach, whereby we map diverse receptor conformations taken from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations totaling approximately 0.5 micros. Our results reveal distinct pockets formed at both solvent-exposed and lipid-exposed cavities, which we interpret in light of experimental data and which may constitute novel targets for GPCR drug discovery. This mapping data can now serve to drive a combination of fragment-based and virtual screening approaches for the discovery of small molecules that bind at these sites and which may offer highly selective therapies.},

  ABSTRACT = {An expanding repertoire of "allosteric" drugs is revealing that structure-based drug design (SBDD) is not restricted to the "active site" of the target protein. Such compounds have been shown to bind distant regions of the protein topography, potentially providing higher levels of target specificity, reduced toxicity and access to new regions of chemical space. Unfortunately, the location of such allosteric pockets is not obvious in the absence of a bound crystal structure and the ability to predict their presence would be useful in the discovery of novel therapies. Here, we describe a method for the prediction of "druggable" binding sites that takes protein flexibility into account through the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. By using a dynamic representation of the target, we are able to sample multiple protein conformations that may expose new drug-binding surfaces. We perform a fragment-based mapping analysis of individual structures in the MD ensemble using the FTMAP algorithm and then rank the most prolific probe-binding protein residues to determine potential "hot-spots" for further examination. This approach has recently been applied to a pair of human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), resulting in the detection of five potential allosteric sites.},

  ABSTRACT = {Simulating protein folding has been a challenging problem for decades due to the long timescales involved (compared with what is possible to simulate) and the challenges of gaining insight from the complex nature of the resulting simulation data. Markov State Models (MSMs) present a means to tackle both of these challenges, yielding simulations on experimentally relevant timescales, statistical significance, and coarse grained representations that are readily humanly understandable. Here, we review this method with the intended audience of non-experts, in order to introduce the method to a broader audience. We review the motivations, methods, and caveats of MSMs, as well as some recent highlights of applications of the method. We conclude by discussing how this approach is part of a paradigm shift in how one uses simulations, away from anecdotal single-trajectory approaches to a more comprehensive statistical approach.

MSMs can predict both stationary and kinetic quantities on long timescales (e.g. milliseconds) using a set of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that are individually much shorter, thus addressing the well-known sampling problem in molecular dynamics simulation. In addition to providing predictive quantitative models, MSMs greatly facilitate both the extraction of insight into biomolecular mechanism (such as folding and functional dynamics) and quantitative comparison with single-molecule and ensemble kinetics experiments. A variety of methodological advances and software packages now bring the construction of these models closer to routine practice. Here, we review recent progress in this field, considering theoretical and methodological advances, new software tools, and recent applications of these approaches in several domains of biochemistry and biophysics, commenting on remaining challenges.},

  ABSTRACT = {Markov state models of molecular kinetics (MSMs), in which the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule is approximated by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.

Here we sketch our current perspective of Markov models and explain in short their theoretical basis and assumptions. We describe transition path theory which allows the entire ensemble of protein folding pathways to be investigated and that combines naturally with Markov models. Experimental observations can be naturally linked to Markov models with the dynamical fingerprint theory, by which experimentally observable timescales can be equipped with an understanding of the structural rearrangement processes that take place at these timescales. The concepts of this paper are illustrated by a simple kinetic model of protein folding.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two strategies have been recently employed to push molecular simulation to long, biologically relevant time scales: projection-based analysis of results from specialized hardware producing a small number of ultralong trajectories and the statistical interpretation of massive parallel sampling performed with Markov state models (MSMs). Here, we assess the MSM as an analysis method by constructing a Markov model from ultralong trajectories, specifically two previously reported 100 mus trajectories of the FiP35 WW domain (Shaw, D. E. Science 2010, 330, 341-346). We find that the MSM approach yields novel insights. It discovers new statistically significant folding pathways, in which either beta-hairpin of the WW domain can form first. The rates of this process approach experimental values in a direct quantitative comparison (time scales of 5.0 mus and 100 ns), within a factor of approximately 2. Finally, the hub-like topology of the MSM and identification of a holo conformation predicts how WW domains may function through a conformational selection mechanism.},

  ABSTRACT = {Computer simulations can complement experiments by providing insight into molecular kinetics with atomic resolution. Unfortunately, even the most powerful supercomputers can only simulate small systems for short time scales, leaving modeling of most biologically relevant systems and time scales intractable. In this work, however, we show that molecular simulations driven by adaptive sampling of networks called Markov State Models (MSMs) can yield tremendous time and resource savings, allowing previously intractable calculations to be performed on a routine basis on existing hardware. We also introduce a distance metric (based on the relative entropy) for comparing MSMs. We primarily employ this metric to judge the convergence of various sampling schemes but it could also be employed to assess the effects of perturbations to a system (e.g., determining how changing the temperature or making a mutation changes a system's dynamics).},

  ABSTRACT = {The B1 domain of protein G has been a classic model system of folding for decades, the subject of numerous experimental and computational studies. Most of the experimental work has focused on whether the protein folds via an intermediate, but the evidence is mostly limited to relatively slow kinetic observations with a few structural probes. In this work we observe folding on the submillisecond timescale with microfluidic mixers using a variety of probes including tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, and photochemical oxidation. We find that each probe yields different kinetics and compare these observations with a Markov State Model constructed from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and find a complex network of states that yield different kinetics for different observables. We conclude that there are many folding pathways before the final folding step and that these paths do not have large free energy barriers.},

  ABSTRACT = {The C-terminal domain of the bacterial transcription antiterminator RfaH undergoes a dramatic all-$\alpha$-helix to all-?-barrel transition when released from its N-terminal domain. These two distinct folding patterns correspond to different functions: the all-$\alpha$ state acts as an essential regulator of transcription to ensure RNA polymerase binding, whereas the all-? state operates as an activator of translation by interacting with the ribosomal protein S10 and recruits ribosomal mRNA. Accordingly, this drastic conformational change enables RfaH to physically couple the transcription and translation processes in gene expression. To understand the mechanism behind this extraordinary functionally relevant structural transition, we constructed Markov state models using an adaptive seeding method.

  ABSTRACT = {We investigate how the molecular mechanism of monomer addition to a growing amyloid fibril of the transthyretin TTR105-115 peptide is affected by pH. Using Markov state models to extract equilibrium and dynamical information from extensive all atom simulations allowed us to characterize both productive pathways in monomer addition as well as several off-pathway trapped states. We found that multiple pathways result in successful addition. All productive pathways are driven by the central hydrophobic residues in the peptide. Furthermore, we show that the slowest transitions in the system involve trapped configurations, that is, long-lived metastable states. These traps dominate the rate of fibril growth. Changing the pH essentially reweights the system, leading to clear differences in the relative importance of both productive paths and traps, yet retains the core mechanism.},

  ABSTRACT = {To date, the slowest-folding proteins folded ab initio by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have had folding times in the range of nanoseconds to microseconds. We report simulations of several folding trajectories of NTL9(1-39), a protein which has a folding time of approximately 1.5 ms. Distributed molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on GPU processors were used to generate ensembles of trajectories out to approximately 40 micros for several temperatures and starting states. At a temperature less than the melting point of the force field, we observe a small number of productive folding events, consistent with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled two-state simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding rate predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding rate (approximately 640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of two-state folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse mesoscopic substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000 macrostates transited by the top 10 folding pathways reveals that native-like pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for macrostates with p(fold) > 0.5, suggesting beta(12) hairpin formation may be rate-limiting. We believe that using simulation data such as these to seed adaptive resampling simulations will be a promising new method for achieving statistically converged descriptions of folding landscapes at longer time scales than ever before.},

  ABSTRACT = {The understanding of protein-ligand binding is of critical importance for biomedical research, yet the process itself has been very difficult to study because of its intrinsically dynamic character. Here, we have been able to quantitatively reconstruct the complete binding process of the enzyme-inhibitor complex trypsin-benzamidine by performing 495 molecular dynamics simulations of free ligand binding of 100 ns each, 187 of which produced binding events with an rmsd less than 2 Å compared to the crystal structure. The binding paths obtained are able to capture the kinetic pathway of the inhibitor diffusing from solvent (S0) to the bound (S4) state passing through two metastable intermediate states S2 and S3. Rather than directly entering the binding pocket the inhibitor appears to roll on the surface of the protein in its transition between S3 and the final binding pocket, whereas the transition between S2 and the bound pose requires rediffusion to S3. An estimation of the standard free energy of binding gives $\Delta$G° = -5.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mol (cf. the experimental value -6.2 kcal/mol), and a two-states kinetic model k(on) = (1.5 ± 0.2) × 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) and k(off) = (9.5 ± 3.3) × 10(4) s(-1) for unbound to bound transitions. The ability to reconstruct by simple diffusion the binding pathway of an enzyme-inhibitor binding process demonstrates the predictive power of unconventional high-throughput molecular simulations. Moreover, the methodology is directly applicable to other molecular systems and thus of general interest in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Energy landscape theory predicts that the folding funnel for a small fast-folding alpha-helical protein will have a transition state half-way to the native state. Estimates of the position of the transition state along an appropriate reaction coordinate can be obtained from linear free energy relationships observed for folding and unfolding rate constants as a function of denaturant concentration. The experimental results of Huang and Oas for lambda repressor, Fersht and collaborators for C12, and Gray and collaborators for cytochrome c indicate a free energy barrier midway between the folded and unfolded regions. This barrier arises from an entropic bottleneck for the folding process. RESULTS: In keeping with the experimental results, lattice simulations based on the folding funnel description show that the transition state is not just a single conformation, but rather an ensemble of a relatively large number of configurations that can be described by specific values of one or a few order parameters (e.g. the fraction of native contacts). Analysis of this transition state or bottleneck region from our lattice simulations and from atomistic models for small alpha-helical proteins by Boczko and Brooks indicates a broad distribution for native contact participation in the transition state ensemble centered around 50{\%}. Importantly, however, the lattice-simulated transition state ensemble does include some particularly hot contacts, as seen in the experiments, which have been termed by others a folding nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Linear free energy relations provide a crude spectroscopy of the transition state, allowing us to infer the values of a reaction coordinate based on the fraction of native contacts. This bottleneck may be thought of as a collection of delocalized nuclei where different native contacts will have different degrees of participation. The agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions provides strong support for the landscape analysis.},

  ABSTRACT = {The energy landscape theory of protein folding is a statistical description of a protein's potential surface. It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed. The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure prediction.},

This method of localization smoothly generalizes the global criterion for an energy landscape to be funneled to the native state, which is in keeping with the principle of minimal frustration.

In contrast, highly frustrated interactions are found clustered on the surface, often near binding sites. These binding sites become less frustrated upon complex formation.},

Local violations of this principle open up possibilities to form the complex multifunnel energy landscapes needed for large-scale conformational changes. We survey the local frustration patterns of allosteric domains and show that the regions that reconfigure are often enriched in patches of highly frustrated interactions, consistent both with the idea that these locally frustrated regions may act as specific hinges or that proteins may "crack" in these locations. On the other hand, the symmetry of multimeric protein assemblies allows near degeneracy by reconfiguring while maintaining minimally frustrated interactions. We also anecdotally examine some specific examples of complex conformational changes and speculate on the role of frustration in the kinetics of allosteric change.},

  ABSTRACT = {The frustratometer is an energy landscape theory-inspired algorithm that aims at quantifying the location of frustration manifested in protein molecules. Frustration is a useful concept for gaining insight to the proteins biological behavior by analyzing how the energy is distributed in protein structures and how mutations or conformational changes shift the energetics. Sites of high local frustration often indicate biologically important regions involved in binding or allostery. In contrast, minimally frustrated linkages comprise a stable folding core of the molecule that is conserved in conformational changes. Here, we describe the implementation of these ideas in a webserver freely available at the National EMBNet node-Argentina, at URL: http://lfp.qb.fcen.uba.ar/embnet/.},

@ARTICLE{Go1984a,
  ABSTRACT = {1.i) It is pointed out that various energy terms contributing to stabilize the native state of globular proteins are consistent in the first approximation with each other in the native state. This means that each energy term is individually minimized at the minimum point of the total energy. I proposed (1) to call this fact “the consistency principle in protein structure.”2.ii) The fair success of various methods of prediction of the secondary structures in globular proteins from their amino acid sequence is often interpreted as indicating the dominance of the short-range interactions in determining the local structures of the polypeptide chains. Partly from such a point of view, the hierarchic condensation model has been popular for the process of protein folding. However the consistency principle indicates that the short-range interactions are just one type of intramolecular interaction which contributes to stabilization of the native structure together with other mutually consistent types of intramolecular interactions. Therefore the hierarchic condensation model is not necessarily a unique model of protein folding.3.iii) Roles of a possible nonspecific globular state, stabilized by nonspecific long-range intramolecular interactions, in the folding process are discussed. It is expected that this nonspecific globular state is observed either as an equilibrium or a kinetic intermediate state between the unfolded and the folded native states. Observation as a kinetic intermediate state is expected to occur in experiments done under strongly refolding conditions. In this case the polypeptide chain in the unfolded state collapses into a nonspecific globule by the action of nonspecific long-range intramolecular interactions. Two possible mechanisms of the transition from the nonspecific globular state to the specific native folded state are discussed.4.iv) In an experiment done under weakly refolding conditions, folding is expected to occur according to the embryo-nucleus model. This model is a refined version of the hierarchic condensation model. Refinement is done by taking into account the fact that the intermediate structures assumed in the hierarchic condensation model are unstable against both the native folded state and the unfolded state. A nucleus is an ordered structure of a certain size. Ordered structures of a size larger than a nucleus tend to fold further to become the native specific globule. Ordered structures of a size smaller than a nucleus tend to unfold. Embryos are intrinsically unstable ordered structures smaller than a nucleus. Folding occurs when embryos grow in size to become a nucleus. The intrinsic instability of embryos is the built-in mechanism to overcome the low resolving power of the short-range interactions in determining local conformations of the polypeptide chain.},

  ABSTRACT = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

  ABSTRACT = {Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

  ABSTRACT = {Comparative protein structure prediction is limited mostly by the errors in alignment and loop modeling. We describe here a new automated modeling technique that significantly improves the accuracy of loop predictions in protein structures. The positions of all nonhydrogen atoms of the loop are optimized in a fixed environment with respect to a pseudo energy function. The energy is a sum of many spatial restraints that include the bond length, bond angle, and improper dihedral angle terms from the CHARMM-22 force field, statistical preferences for the main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles, and statistical preferences for nonbonded atomic contacts that depend on the two atom types, their distance through space, and separation in sequence. The energy function is optimized with the method of conjugate gradients combined with molecular dynamics and simulated annealing. Typically, the predicted loop conformation corresponds to the lowest energy conformation among 500 independent optimizations. Predictions were made for 40 loops of known structure at each length from 1 to 14 residues. The accuracy of loop predictions is evaluated as a function of thoroughness of conformational sampling, loop length, and structural properties of native loops. When accuracy is measured by local superposition of the model on the native loop, 100, 90, and 30{\%} of 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loop predictions, respectively, had <2 A RMSD error for the mainchain N, C(alpha), C, and O atoms; the average accuracies were 0.59 +/- 0.05, 1.16 +/- 0.10, and 2.61 +/- 0.16 A, respectively. To simulate real comparative modeling problems, the method was also evaluated by predicting loops of known structure in only approximately correct environments with errors typical of comparative modeling without misalignment. When the RMSD distortion of the main-chain stem atoms is 2.5 A, the average loop prediction error increased by 180, 25, and 3{\%} for 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loops, respectively. The accuracy of the lowest energy prediction for a given loop can be estimated from the structural variability among a number of low energy predictions. The relative value of the present method is gauged by (1) comparing it with one of the most successful previously described methods, and (2) describing its accuracy in recent blind predictions of protein structure. Finally, it is shown that the average accuracy of prediction is limited primarily by the accuracy of the energy function rather than by the extent of conformational sampling.},

  ABSTRACT = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is a common goal in biology, and is usually facilitated by having an accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allostery is a phenomenon that couples effector ligand binding at an allosteric site to a structural and/or dynamic change at a distant regulated site. To study an allosteric transition, we vary the size of the allosteric site and its interactions to construct a series of energy landscapes with pronounced minima corresponding to both the effector bound and unbound crystal structures. We use molecular dynamics to sample these landscapes. The degree of perturbation by the effector, modeled by the size of the allosteric site, provides an order parameter for allostery that allows us to determine how microscopic motions give rise to commonly discussed macroscopic mechanisms: (i) induced fit, (ii) population shift, and (iii) entropy driven. These mechanisms involve decreasing structural differences between the effector bound and unbound populations. A metric (ligand-induced cooperativity) can measure how cooperatively a given regulated site responds to effector binding and therefore what kind of allosteric mechanism is involved. We apply the model to three proteins with experimentally characterized transitions: (i) calmodulin-GFP Ca(2+) sensor protein, (ii) maltose binding protein, and (iii) CSL transcription factor. Remarkably, the model is able to reproduce allosteric motion and predict coupling in a manner consistent with experiment.},

  ABSTRACT = {By representing the high-resolution crystal structures of a number of enzymes using the elastic network model, it has been shown that only a few low-frequency normal modes are needed to describe the large-scale domain movements that are triggered by ligand binding. Here we explore a link between the nearly invariant nature of the modes that describe functional dynamics at the mesoscopic level and the large evolutionary sequence variations at the residue level. By using a structural perturbation method (SPM), which probes the residue-specific response to perturbations (or mutations), we identify a sparse network of strongly conserved residues that transmit allosteric signals in three structurally unrelated biological nanomachines, namely, DNA polymerase, myosin motor, and the Escherichia coli chaperonin. Based on the response of every mode to perturbations, which are generated by interchanging specific sequence pairs in a multiple sequence alignment, we show that the functionally relevant low-frequency modes are most robust to sequence variations. Our work shows that robustness of dynamical modes at the mesoscopic level is encoded in the structure through a sparse network of residues that transmit allosteric signals.},

  ABSTRACT = {In allosteric regulation, protein activity is altered when ligand binding causes changes in the protein conformational distribution. Little is known about which aspects of protein design lead to effective allosteric regulation, however. To increase understanding of the relation between protein structure and allosteric effects, we have developed theoretical tools to quantify the influence of protein-ligand interactions on probability distributions of reaction rates and protein conformations. We define the rate divergence, Dk, and the allosteric potential, Dx, as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between either the reaction-rate distributions or protein conformational distributions with and without the ligand bound. We then define Dx as the change in the conformational distribution of the combined protein/ligand system, derive Dx in the harmonic approximation, and identify contributions from 3 separate terms: the first term, D[stackxomega], results from changes in the eigenvalue spectrum; the second term, D[stackxDeltax], results from changes in the mean conformation; and the third term, Dxv, corresponds to changes in the eigenvectors. Using normal modes analysis, we have calculated these terms for a natural interaction between lysozyme and the ligand tri-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and compared them with calculations for a large number of simulated random interactions. The comparison shows that interactions in the known binding-site are associated with large values of Dxv. The results motivate using allosteric potential calculations to predict functional binding sites on proteins, and suggest the possibility that, in Nature, effective ligand interactions occur at intrinsic control points at which binding induces a relatively large change in the protein conformational distribution.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: An elastic network model is proposed for the interactions between closely (< or = 7.0 A) located alpha-carbon pairs in folded proteins. A single-parameter harmonic potential is adopted for the fluctuations of residues about their mean positions in the crystal structure. The model is based on writing the Kirchhoff adjacency matrix for a protein defining the proximity of residues in space. The elements of the inverse of the Kirchhoff matrix give directly the auto-correlations or cross-correlations of atomic fluctuations. RESULTS: The temperature factors of the C alpha atoms of 12 X-ray structures, ranging from a 41 residue subunit to a 633 residue dimer, are accurately predicted. Cross-correlations are also efficiently characterized, in close agreement with results obtained with a normal mode analysis coupled with energy minimization. CONCLUSIONS: The simple model and method proposed here provide a satisfactory description of the correlations between atomic fluctuations. Furthermore, this is achieved within computation times at least one order of magnitude shorter than commonly used molecular approaches.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a criterion for optimal parameter selection in coarse-grained models of proteins and develop a refined elastic network model (ENM) of bovine trypsinogen. The unimodal density-of-states distribution of the trypsinogen ENM disagrees with the bimodal distribution obtained from an all-atom model; however, the bimodal distribution is recovered by strengthening interactions between atoms that are backbone neighbors. We use the backbone-enhanced model to analyze allosteric mechanisms of trypsinogen and find relatively strong communication between the regulatory and active sites.},

  ABSTRACT = {We overview here our recent work on the thermodynamic view of allosteric regulation and communication. Starting from the geometry-based prediction of regulatory binding sites in a static structure, we move on to exploring a connection between ligand binding and the intrinsic dynamics of the protein molecule. We describe here two recently introduced measures, binding leverage and leverage coupling, which allow one to analyze the molecular basis of allosteric regulation. We discuss the advantages of these measures and show that they work universally in proteins of different sizes, oligomeric states, and functions. We also point the problems that have to be solved before completing an atomic level description of allostery, and briefly discuss ideas for computational design of allosteric drugs. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: The emerging dynamic view of proteins: Protein plasticity in allostery, evolution and self-assembly.},

  ABSTRACT = {An important aspect of understanding protein allostery, and of artificial effector design, is the characterization and prediction of substrate- and effector-binding sites. To find binding sites in allosteric enzymes, many of which are oligomeric with allosteric sites at domain interfaces, we devise a local centrality measure for residue interaction graphs, which behaves well for both small/monomeric and large/multimeric proteins. The measure is purely structure based and has a clear geometrical interpretation and no free parameters. It is not biased towards typically catalytic residues, a property that is crucial when looking for non-catalytic effector sites, which are potent drug targets.},

  ABSTRACT = {Allosteric regulation involves conformational transitions or fluctuations between a few closely related states, caused by the binding of effector molecules. We introduce a quantity called binding leverage that measures the ability of a binding site to couple to the intrinsic motions of a protein. We use Monte Carlo simulations to generate potential binding sites and either normal modes or pairs of crystal structures to describe relevant motions. We analyze single catalytic domains and multimeric allosteric enzymes with complex regulation. For the majority of the analyzed proteins, we find that both catalytic and allosteric sites have high binding leverage. Furthermore, our analysis of the catabolite activator protein, which is allosteric without conformational change, shows that its regulation involves other types of motion than those modulated at sites with high binding leverage. Our results point to the importance of incorporating dynamic information when predicting functional sites. Because it is possible to calculate binding leverage from a single crystal structure it can be used for characterizing proteins of unknown function and predicting latent allosteric sites in any protein, with implications for drug design.},

It proposes easily tractable and meaningful measures that allow users to analyze the effect of ligand binding on the intrinsic protein dynamics. The server shows potential allosteric sites and allows users to explore communication between the regulatory and functional sites. It is possible to explore, for instance, potential effector binding sites in a given structure as targets for allosteric drugs. As input, the server only requires a single structure.

  ABSTRACT = {Markov state models (MSMs) have been successful in computing metastable states, slow relaxation timescales and associated structural changes, and stationary or kinetic experimental observables of complex molecules from large amounts of molecular dynamics simulation data. However, MSMs approximate the true dynamics by assuming a Markov chain on a clusters discretization of the state space. This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional biomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of MSMs has, therefore, been limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on the discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase-space molecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is observed on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov Models (PMMs). Robust estimation methods for PMMs are not yet available, but we derive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It is shown how various molecular observables of interest that are often computed from MSMs can be computed from HMMs/PMMs. The new framework is applicable to both, simulation and single-molecule experimental data. We demonstrate its versatility by applications to educative model systems, a 1 ms Anton MD simulation of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein, and an optical tweezer force probe trajectory of an RNA hairpin.},

  ABSTRACT = {Whole-cell modeling has the potential to play a major role in revolutionizing our understanding of cellular biology over the next few decades. A computational model of the entire cell would allow cellular biologists to integrate data from many disparate sources in a single consistent framework. Such a comprehensive model would be useful both for hypothesis testing and in the discovery of new behaviors that emerge from complex biological networks. Cellular and molecular structure can and should be a key organizing principle in a whole-cell model, connecting models across time and length scales in a multiscale approach. Here I present a summary of recent research centered around using molecular and cellular structure to model the behavior of cells.},

  ABSTRACT = {A general framework of image-based geometric processing is presented to bridge the gap between three-dimensional (3D) imaging that provides structural details of a biological system and mathematical simulation where high-quality surface or volumetric meshes are required. A 3D density map is processed in the order of image pre-processing (contrast enhancement and anisotropic filtering), feature extraction (boundary segmentation and skeletonization), and high-quality and realistic surface (triangular) and volumetric (tetrahedral) mesh generation. While the tool-chain described is applicable to general types of 3D imaging data, the performance is demonstrated specifically on membrane-bound organelles in ventricular myocytes that are imaged and reconstructed with electron microscopic (EM) tomography and two-photon microscopy (T-PM). Of particular interest in this study are two types of membrane-bound Ca(2+)-handling organelles, namely, transverse tubules (T-tubules) and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR), both of which play an important role in regulating the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling through dynamic Ca(2+) mobilization in cardiomyocytes.},

  ABSTRACT = {A method of triangular surface mesh smoothing is presented to improve angle quality by extending the original optimal Delaunay triangulation (ODT) to surface meshes. The mesh quality is improved by solving a quadratic optimization problem that minimizes the approximated interpolation error between a parabolic function and its piecewise linear interpolation defined on the mesh. A suboptimal problem is derived to guarantee a unique, analytic solution that is significantly faster with little loss in accuracy as compared to the optimal one. In addition to the quality-improving capability, the proposed method has been adapted to remove noise while faithfully preserving sharp features such as edges and corners of a mesh. Numerous experiments are included to demonstrate the performance of the method.},
