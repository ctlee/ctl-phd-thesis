@article{Gao2013,
abstract = {A method of triangular surface mesh smoothing is presented to improve angle quality by extending the original optimal Delaunay triangulation (ODT) to surface meshes. The mesh quality is improved by solving a quadratic optimization problem that minimizes the approximated interpolation error between a parabolic function and its piecewise linear interpolation defined on the mesh. A suboptimal problem is derived to guarantee a unique, analytic solution that is significantly faster with little loss in accuracy as compared to the optimal one. In addition to the quality-improving capability, the proposed method has been adapted to remove noise while faithfully preserving sharp features such as edges and corners of a mesh. Numerous experiments are included to demonstrate the performance of the method.},

abstract = {Whole-cell modeling has the potential to play a major role in revolutionizing our understanding of cellular biology over the next few decades. A computational model of the entire cell would allow cellular biologists to integrate data from many disparate sources in a single consistent framework. Such a comprehensive model would be useful both for hypothesis testing and in the discovery of new behaviors that emerge from complex biological networks. Cellular and molecular structure can and should be a key organizing principle in a whole-cell model, connecting models across time and length scales in a multiscale approach. Here I present a summary of recent research centered around using molecular and cellular structure to model the behavior of cells.},

@article{Yu2008a,
abstract = {A general framework of image-based geometric processing is presented to bridge the gap between three-dimensional (3D) imaging that provides structural details of a biological system and mathematical simulation where high-quality surface or volumetric meshes are required. A 3D density map is processed in the order of image pre-processing (contrast enhancement and anisotropic filtering), feature extraction (boundary segmentation and skeletonization), and high-quality and realistic surface (triangular) and volumetric (tetrahedral) mesh generation. While the tool-chain described is applicable to general types of 3D imaging data, the performance is demonstrated specifically on membrane-bound organelles in ventricular myocytes that are imaged and reconstructed with electron microscopic (EM) tomography and two-photon microscopy (T-PM). Of particular interest in this study are two types of membrane-bound Ca(2+)-handling organelles, namely, transverse tubules (T-tubules) and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR), both of which play an important role in regulating the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling through dynamic Ca(2+) mobilization in cardiomyocytes.},
